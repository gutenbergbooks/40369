<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p><b>The purpose of this series.</b> This series of readers is definitely
designed to provide working material for the development
of efficient "silent reading". It is not planned to compete
with the many excellent series of readers now available.
The authors believe that it will efficiently supplement the well-nigh
universal school practice of conducting all reading lessons
aloud.</p>

<p><b>Oral reading not sufficient.</b> In the majority of classes the
pupils are all supplied with the same text. One pupil reads
aloud while the others are supposed to follow his reading
silently. When he has finished his portion of the text, the
teacher or the pupils make corrections of his pronunciation
or phrasing, and the teacher may ask questions or add comments
or explanations. This incentive to adequate expression
by the reader is lacking because his classmates all have the
text before them; it is natural for the hearers to read on ahead
of the oral reader if the material is of interest; and it is perfectly
easy for them to gaze absently at the book while employing
their minds with matters wholly unrelated to the class
exercise. Perhaps most important of all, reading aloud is an
experience of rare occurrence outside the classroom, while
silent reading is a universal daily experience for all but the
illiterate.</p>

<p>The mechanics of reading are fairly well mastered in the
third&mdash;some authorities say the second&mdash;grade. Some oral
reading is doubtless desirable beyond these grades, but the
relative amount should diminish rapidly.</p>

<p>Experts have recognized the importance of silent reading
for many years. Briggs and Coffman showed its value in their
book, "Reading in Public Schools," published in 1908. Studies
in this field have been made by Gray, Starch, Judd, Courtis,
Monroe, Kelly, and many others. They have made no attempt
to deny that oral reading has a place in the curriculum,
but have merely pointed out that from the third grade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
on its place is less and less important in comparison with silent
reading.</p>

<p><b>Reading to get the thought quickly.</b> Once the mechanics of
reading are mastered, the problem becomes one of speed and
accuracy in thought-getting. Upon these two qualities depends
the pupil's progress in school and his use of the deluge of ideas
that appeal only through the printed page. If he reads and
understands, if he quickly grasps the important idea from a
mass of details, if he arranges the relations of the ideas presented,
we say that he is good in geography, history, science,
or mathematics. If he comprehends only slowly or fails to
understand, he is a dullard or a defective.</p>

<p><b>Speed usually goes with comprehension.</b> At first glance it
would seem that comprehension would be inversely proportional
to speed; that is, the greater the speed the poorer the
comprehension and <i>vice versa</i>. The standard tests of Gray,
Courtis, Kelly, and Monroe, however, which have been given
to thousands of children, prove exactly the reverse. The
rapid silent readers have almost invariably shown the best
understanding of the matter read. It would thus seem that
concentrated effort on either speed or comprehension would
tend to improve the other factor. It is necessary, however,
to test speed results carefully to insure conscientious reading
of the text.</p>

<p><b>The material in these books.</b> In selecting the material for
these books the authors have purposely avoided the established
paths of literary reputation, and have selected from
a wide variety of sources interesting material representative
of the printed matter the child will inevitably read. Every
effort has been made to avoid the necessity of explanation by
the teacher to elucidate the text. In general, the exercises
have been under- rather than over-graded, as the pupil
should read for content and should be as far as possible relieved
from technical grammatical or vocabulary difficulties. Occasionally,
however, in each book exercises somewhat more
difficult or of a more or less unusual nature have been included,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
because everyone, old or young, is called upon to read a variety
of material, and pupils should have some experience with
selections that require special effort.</p>

<p><b>Why we read.</b> Most of the reading which we do has one of
three purposes: we read for information; we read for instruction;
we read for appreciation or entertainment. These purposes
are somewhat determined by the nature of the material
read. Rarely do we read an encyclopedia article for appreciation.
On the other hand, we lose ourselves in the quiet
humor of Rip Van Winkle merely for entertainment through
appreciation. Contrasted with this would be our reading of
a biography of Irving in order to find out who were his American
contemporaries. The boy who reads an explanation of
how to make a rabbit trap with the purpose of making one
is reading for instruction, while his father who scans the evening
paper to see how his representative in Congress or the State
Legislature voted on a bill is reading purely for information.</p>

<p><b>The Pedagogical Editing.</b> The authors have kept constantly
in mind the purposes of each selection in the directions they
have given to the pupils. They have also had clearly in mind
certain fundamental things that they wish pupils to learn
and certain habits which they wish them to form by the use
of these books. A perusal of the directions given before and
after any given selection will suffice to make this purpose
clear. For example, much attention is given to the writing
of headings for certain parts of a selection or to the statement
of the most important thought in a given paragraph. With
increasing emphasis in the upper grades this type of exercise
is developed into the complete outline. The authors believe
that practice of this kind will develop in pupils the habit of
looking for the important thought and of grouping around it
related subordinate ideas. This is perhaps the habit most
essential to good reading for instruction or information. On
the other hand, selections which are of a purely literary character
and which should be read for appreciation and entertainment
are given without exhaustive notes or questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
because minute discussion of this kind of reading would detract
from its value.</p>

<p><b>Method of handling the books.</b> Many teachers will prefer
to keep the books in the class room, distributing them at the
time of the silent reading lesson and collecting them again at
its conclusion. In this way the material will remain fresh,
and the drill exercises will always be under the control of the
teacher.</p>

<p>In many places, however, text books are not supplied by
the school authorities, but are purchased by the pupils directly.
Inasmuch as this series of books contains all the necessary
instruction for the use of each exercise, they become peculiarly
helpful where the pupil is thrown upon his own resources.
He is able to test his own speed and comprehension and his
ability to analyze or outline any of the material by the plain
directions that are given for handling the books. Although
the instructions accompanying various selections are addressed
to the pupils, they contain suggestions for the teacher. It is,
therefore, important that the teacher read in advance of the
lesson such instructions or comments as appear before or
after the text or the particular exercise to be read.</p>

<p><b>Speed drills.</b> As much of the value of teaching silent reading
lies in the development of speed, a number of exercises are
designated as speed drills. For these drills it is suggested that
the teacher prepare, on the mimeograph if possible, a considerable
number of slips to be filled out arranged as follows:</p>

<p>For a speed drill the teacher should have one of these slips
and a watch with a second hand. A stop watch would be
valuable. Directions should be given for all the pupils to begin
reading at the same moment and raise their hands as a signal
to the teacher when they have finished. The teacher should
give the signal for them to begin as the second hand of her
watch reaches sixty. As each pupil raises his hand indicating
that he has finished, the teacher should note the time in half
minutes opposite that pupil's name on the drill sheet. Any
pupil's time should be indicated at the nearest half minute
space. For example, a pupil who finishes at two minutes
ten seconds should be marked as two minutes; one who finishes
at two minutes twenty seconds, at two and one-half.</p>

<p><b>Mode and Median.</b> In the illustration above, the sheet has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
been filled with names and scores of a supposed fifth grade
class of twenty pupils. On this sheet three minutes occurs
once, three and one-half minutes once, four minutes three times,
four and one-half minutes twice, five minutes six times, five
and one-half minutes twice, six minutes four times and eight
and one-half minutes once. The number occurring the largest
number of times is five.</p>

<p>This number is called the "mode".</p>

<p>If all the scores are arranged in order with the highest
score at the top and the lowest score at the bottom, the middle
score in this series is called the "median" and is in this case
also "five".</p>

<p><b>Individual scores.</b> The class median or mode is, however,
not so significant as the individual scores. The class score is
always determined by the ease or difficulty as well as by the
length of the particular exercise read. This makes comparison
with other exercises almost valueless. The only significant
comparison in this case is between individuals of the same
class, and between the score of this class and of other classes
of parallel grade who have read the same exercise.</p>

<p>Important facts for G. P. W., the class teacher, in this case
are the individual scores and their relative standing. Roy
Hunt, who took eight and one-half minutes to read this exercise,
is the slowest reader on this occasion. Is this true of
other occasions? If so, Roy needs special help and training.
It is also clear that Joseph Carmalt and Alice Wilson are rapid
readers and it is important to see that their comprehension of
the exercise is also adequate. Thus, for the class teacher the
important facts are the relative scores of the pupils both in
comparison with other pupils and with the former scores of
the same pupils.</p>

<p><b>Scale of approximate speed.</b> The following scale of speeds
by grades is based roughly on the Courtis standard tests and
may be somewhat helpful to the teacher who may desire
such norms.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course it must be recognized that no standard speeds
are possible without also standardizing the material. To be
absolutely accurate, each separate exercise should be its own
speed standard. This, although possible, would be a device
so cumbersome as to defeat its own purpose. Every bit of
reading presents its peculiar difficulties, its slow spots, its
points of interest, its urge to hurry on. These in turn vary
with the apperception of the reader, with his peculiarities,
his interests, and his motives. These largely determine his
speed. The authors have thought it unwise in the vast majority
of cases to indicate with any degree of definiteness the time
required for various exercises. Their experience in trying out
these exercises with different classes showed so wide a variation
that it was thought that specific statements would tend
only to mislead the teacher.</p>

<p><b>Testing Comprehension.</b> It is, however, equally important
that the teacher know that the pupils are understanding
what they read. As each pupil is reading silently, there is
no guarantee of comprehension without some form of check.
This may be as simple a device as watching the expression of
the children's faces to see registered there appreciation of the
exercise read; or it may be as complex as a dramatic reproduction
of the incidents.</p>

<p>Devices for checking comprehension are suggested in connection
with each exercise. The more usual and effective
methods of teaching comprehension are dramatization, reproduction,
writing of headlines, development of outlines, expression
of opinion based upon facts read, topical analysis, the
naming of characters and statements of their relationships,
and appreciation of ethical or artistic appeal.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The test material.</b> The drill exercise, although modeled
in some cases upon the standard reading and intelligence tests,
expressly disclaim any attempt to displace or supersede these
tests. The function of the two is wholly different. The
material in the readers is for drill and improvement in speed
and comprehension. The standard tests are for the measurement
of achievement. No devices can be used as a measure
until it has been standardized by application in thousands
of concrete cases without substantial variation.</p>

<p><b>Standard Tests.</b> This is the case with a number of standard
tests now in general use. In the field of reading the most
notable are the Courtis Standard Tests devised by S. A.
Courtis, Director of Instruction, Teacher Training and Research,
and Dean of Teachers College, Detroit, Michigan, and
Walter S. Monroe, Professor of Education and Director of the
Bureau of Educational Research, University of Illinois. The
necessary instructions, record blanks and test sheets giving
these tests may be obtained as follows:</p>

<p>These tests should be given at least once a year and if possible
semi-annually in order to determine progress in speed
and comprehension in silent reading, as well as to measure
the pupils by a well established standard.</p>

<p><b>Topical recitation.</b> Particular emphasis, especially in the
later grades, should be placed upon the complete presentation
of a topic by a pupil standing in front of the class and making
the group understand what he has to say without questions
by the teacher. More and more this is coming to be emphasized
as a means of good teaching everywhere; and pupils
are being trained to stand before a group of their classmates
and give an intelligent account of anything of which they have
adequate knowledge without the painful tooth-pulling process
of extracting ideas.</p>

<p><b>The philosophy of study.</b> One of the most important
results of efficient teaching of silent reading is the contribution
which it makes to the whole problem of study in the school.
Briggs says that the primary purpose of the school is to teach
people to do better the desirable things that they are likely
to do anyway. One of the desirable things that school children
are not only likely but certain to have to do is to study.
A large portion of the studying that the child as well as the adult
does consists in the acquirement of information from the
printed page. It is essentially silent reading. Much of the
difficulty teachers now meet in the inability of their pupils
to study will be dispelled by effective teaching of silent reading.
Probably no use of the same amount of time would
yield more definite and valuable results than will thorough
instruction in the process of thought getting from a printed
page&mdash;in other words&mdash;silent reading.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SILENT_READING" id="SILENT_READING">SILENT READING</a></h2>


<p>The book which you are now beginning is, as its title tells
you, a <i>silent reader</i>; that is, a reader that you are to read
to yourself, silently. It is much more interesting to read
silently than to read aloud, and it is also much faster. With
all the wonderful books and valuable articles that are being
printed every day, it is important that you learn to read
rapidly as well as to understand.</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is to help you to read fast and
to understand clearly what you read. You will find all
sorts of reading; animal stories, poems, fairy tales, problems,
descriptions of strange places, puzzles, war stories,
and lots of other things. We think you will find it very
interesting, but the important thing is to use all this material
to make yourself a rapid and at the same time a careful
reader.</p>

<p>Of course you are much too old to move your lips when
you read. If you have this habit you must break it at once,
for you will never read rapidly as long as you continue to
pronounce words even to yourself. It takes just as long to
pronounce a word to yourself as to read it aloud. You
must learn not to do so, if you are to gain speed in reading.</p>

<p>Your teacher is going to help you in every possible way
and will frequently time you when you read and then test
you to see if you have understood what you have read.
But you will have to do the most yourself if you are really
to learn to read rapidly and well.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="THE_ESKIMO" id="THE_ESKIMO">THE ESKIMO</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>You will be able to remember what you read and to tell
about it much better if you form the habit of making a brief
outline as you go along. You can learn to make this outline
without writing anything down, but in the beginning it would
be a good plan to write down the topics as you come to them.</p>

<p>At the end of this selection you will find suggestions for
making an outline.</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose there was no grocery where you could get bread
or flour or potatoes, no meat shop, no milk dealer. Make
it worse and suppose there was no place where you could
buy clothes, shoes, coal or wood, balls or bats, sleds or
knives. Suppose you had to go without all these things
unless your father and mother or brothers and sisters
helped you to make them. You would all have to work
very hard and even then be poor, and often hungry, cold,
and wet. You could not live in town because there is not
ground enough there to raise potatoes and other things
to eat. You would have to live in the country, where there
is more land near each home. Your father would have to
learn how to build a house, how to make shoes, how to
make his tools, and how to do many things which the people
you know never need to think about now. Your mother
would have to make even the cloth for your clothes and
to prepare all the food you had. That is, your family
would have to make everything that you had in your home,
or that you ate, or wore, or played with, or used in the
garden. They would be busy all the time. Every family
would have to have more businesses or trades than you can
find in some small towns, and many of the things you have
now they could not make at all, so you would not have them.
For a long time, a very long time, that is the way people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
used to live all over the world. It was a hard life. There
are even yet many places where people do not use machines
and where every family makes everything for its own use.</p>

<p>The Eskimos live that way. Their country is far away
to the north. It is a very poor, cold country, where very
few things will grow, so there are not many Eskimos.
Robinson Crusoe tried living all by himself for a while, but
he had a lot of tools from the ship, and his island was rich
in food and wood. He found goats there that gave milk;
he found good wild grapes and other fruits; but he said he
had to work very hard, even though he did not have any
family to support. The Eskimo country is much poorer
than Crusoe's island. It is away up north where the winter
is very long and cold, and the summer is so short that no
trees grow, and there are not many other plants. The
Eskimo has no animals to give milk; he never heard of
potatoes or bread, to say nothing of cake.</p>

<p>It is hard to get the things you need in such a country.
For a winter house the Eskimo often builds a little hut of
snow. Many boys and girls in the cooler parts of the
United States and Canada have built a little snow house
for sport, but the Eskimo finds it the warmest house he
can get. If it has a window, you cannot see through it,
for it is a piece of fish skin that looks like dirty glass.
To keep the cold out he makes the doorway so low that
people must crawl in. Then he builds a long tunnel outside
the door to keep the wind out, and puts a chunk of snow
in the outer end of the tunnel for a door. Along the sides
of the house inside is a bank of snow covered with skins.
This is both chair and bed.</p>

<p>If he made the room as warm as we make our houses, the
roof would melt and drip down his neck. But he does
not have enough fire to warm it much anyhow. The little
fire he has for cooking is made by burning the fat of animals
in an oil lamp.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Eskimo Boy and His Father Fishing</span></p>

<p>Not long ago a man named Rasmussen, whose father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
was a missionary in Greenland and whose mother was an
Eskimo, made a long journey through Eskimo land. At
one place he found a dead whale on the seashore and the
Eskimos there felt as rich as we should if a carload of coal
or fire-wood were dumped down in the yard. They were
busy tearing off strips of the fat, called blubber, that lies
under the whale's skin. Some of them were hauling it two
days' journey on their sleds. Some of the people Rasmussen
saw had never even heard of white men or of any of the
things the white man makes. They themselves had to make
everything they had.</p>

<p>Their boats (or kyaks) were of seal skins sewed into a
water-tight sheet and stretched over a frame-work of
whale rib bones and long walrus tusks, tied together with
sinews and strips of leather. In these tiny boats they
paddle around in the sea and catch seals with spears.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Eskimos live along the seashore where
they can catch fish, seals and walrus. The seal is the greatest
wealth the Eskimo has. The seal eats fish and keeps
warm in the ice-cold water because he has a coat of soft, fine,
water-proof fur, and under his skin a thick layer of fat.
Seal meat is bread to the Eskimo. He cooks with seal fat
and makes clothes, boats, and tents of the sealskin.</p>

<p>In winter the Eskimo wears two suits of fur, one with
the fur inside and the other with the fur outside. In
summer one suit is enough.</p>

<p>When spring comes and the snow house begins to melt,
the Eskimo moves into his sealskin tent or into a stone hut
chinked with dirt. Some of these stone huts are hundreds
of years old. Toward the end of summer there are some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
berries that get ripe on low-growing bushes, and many
bright flowers bloom in the northland. Then the Eskimos
sometimes make trips inland. They eat berries, rabbit
meat, birds, and wild reindeer. Wild ducks and many
other birds are there in summer, but they fly away to warm
lands when cold weather comes, and the people go back
to the seashore to lay in their winter supply of seal meat.</p>

<p>The wild animals that live here all the time do not seem
to mind the cold. They have warm fur, and the rabbit
changes his color to keep from getting caught. He is snow
white in winter so that the fox cannot see him on the snow,
but in summer his coat is brown so that the fox cannot see
him on the ground.</p>

<p>The Eskimo has one helper, the dog that pulls his sled.
We call him the "huskie". This dog has a thick, warm coat
so that he can curl up in the dry snow, put his four feet and
his nose into a little bunch, lay his bushy tail over them,
and sleep through a blinding snow storm that would freeze
a white man to death. Sometimes the snow covers him
entirely as he sleeps and he has to dig himself out when
he wakes up.</p>

<p>When Admiral Peary went over the ice to the North Pole,
in 1909, Eskimo dogs pulled the sleds that carried his food
and tents, and Eskimo men helped him. He found them
to be honest, brave men, trusty helpers, and good friends.</p>

<p>The Eskimos are very fond of games. They play football
and several kinds of shinny, using long bones for
shinny sticks. Sometimes they skate on new smooth ice,
using bone skates tied fast to their soft shoes. As they do
not go to school and have no books, the days must seem long
in bad weather, for they have nothing to do but sit around
the little fire in the dark smoky little snow house. They
have many indoor games. The house is too small to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
tag or run around, so they have sitting down games. There
are as many as fifty kinds of string games something like
our cat's cradle.</p>

<p>This is the simplest kind of living to be found anywhere
in the world. Every family in the world needs a certain
amount of food, clothes, fuel, shelter, tools, and playthings.
In different countries there are different ways of getting
these things, depending on the weather, on the things that
will grow, and the things that man finds in the ground,
or in the woods, or in the sea. Each Eskimo family must
make or get all these things for itself.</p>

<p>The Eskimos do not need money because they do not buy
nor sell. If two Eskimos should meet and want to trade
two dogs for a sled, they would just trade as two schoolboys
swap knives. The Eskimos would be much more comfortable
if they could trade some of their sealskins for lumber
to build houses and for flour and dried fruit to eat with their
never ending meat. We cannot trade with them because
they are too far away for us to build railroads to their land,
and the sea is so full of ice that ships cannot get through it
Perhaps the aeroplane will let us see more of the Eskimo.</p>

<blockquote><p>Glance quickly at the first paragraph. How would this do
as a title or topic for it: "Doing things for yourself"?</p>

<p>The second paragraph connects the idea that it is very hard
to do everything for yourself with the various things told about
the Eskimo in the rest of the story. So that you may understand
better, the Eskimo is compared with Robinson Crusoe,
who had to do everything for himself but had a better chance
because of the country in which he lived. A topic for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
second paragraph might be, "The Eskimo's life compared with
Robinson Crusoe's".</p>

<p>Beginning with the third paragraph, the author tells how the
Eskimo lives. It is not necessary to make a topic for every
paragraph. We can make a general heading under which
some of his ways of living can be grouped. Arrange the
heading and the sub-headings as follows:</p>

<p>How the Eskimo manages to live.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>a</i>) His house.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>b</i>) His food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>c</i>) His clothing.<br />
</p>

<p>Now look through the rest of the story, and you will see that
it can be included under the following headings:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eskimo dog.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eskimo games.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the Eskimo does not buy and sell.<br />
</p>

<p>In making an outline it is not necessary to put in every single
idea in the piece you are outlining.</p>

<p>Now, after going through the selection to see how the outline
is made, you can easily answer the following questions:</p>

<p>1. How does it happen that you do not have to depend on
your own family for the things you eat and wear and use?
Make a list of the people who help you to get the things necessary
for every-day life. Your list might begin with the baker,
the milk-man, and the shoemaker.</p>

<p>2. Try to draw a picture of the outside of the Eskimo's
winter house as it is described here.</p>

<p>3. Make a list of the things you think an Eskimo boy or girl
about your age would do from morning to night&mdash;his day's
program, you may call it.</p>

<p>4. Do you think the Eskimo is glad when summer comes?
Why?</p>

<p>5. Tell a story that a "huskie" might tell of his experiences.</p>

<p>6. Make a list of raw materials, such as wood, that would
make the life of the Eskimo more comfortable.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="SCOTTISH_BORDER_WARFARE" id="SCOTTISH_BORDER_WARFARE">SCOTTISH BORDER WARFARE</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>From your study of the way to make an outline of "The
Eskimo", you will be able to make an outline of "Scottish
Border Warfare" yourself.</p>

<p>Read the selection through, and then go back and write topics
that cover the main points.</p></blockquote>

<p>Legends of the Scottish borders tell the exciting stories
of a warfare that went on for a hundred years, in the days
before England and Scotland were united. The "Borders"
consisted of that part of the country in the South of Scotland
where the boundary was not properly fixed. The
King of England might claim a piece of land that the King
of Scotland thought was his, and the King of Scotland
might do the same by the King of England. And so,
because things were never really settled in these parts, and
men thought they could do pretty much as they liked, a
constant warfare sprang up between the families who lived
on the English side of the border and those who lived on
the Scottish side. These families formed great clans,
almost like the Highland clans, and every man in the clan
rose in arms at the bidding of his chief.</p>

<p>The warfare which they carried on was not honest fighting
so much as something that sounds to us very much
like stealing; only in these old plundering, or "reiving"
days, as they were called, people were not very particular
about other people's property, and right was often decided
by might. So when these old Border chieftains found that
their larders were getting empty, they sent messages around
the countryside to their retainers, telling them to meet
them that night at some secret trysting-place, and ride with
them into England to steal some English yeoman's flock of
sheep.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>In the darkness, groups of men, mounted on rough,
shaggy ponies, would assemble at some lonely spot among
the hills and ride stealthily into Cumberland or Northumberland,
and surround some Englishman's little flock of
sheep, or herd of cattle, and drive them off, setting fire,
perhaps, to his cottage and haystacks at the same time.</p>

<p>The Englishman might be unable to retaliate at the
moment, but no sooner were the reivers' backs turned than
he betook himself with all haste to his chieftain, who, in his
turn, gathered his men together, and rode over into Scotland
to take vengeance, and, if possible, bring back with
him a larger drove of sheep and cattle than had been stolen,
or "lifted", by the Scotch.</p>

<p>And so things went merrily on, with raids and counter-raids,
and fierce little encounters, and brave men slain.
You can read the accounts of many of these raids in Sir
Walter Scott's "Border Minstrelsy"&mdash;about "Kinmont
Willie," "Dick o' the Cow," "Jamie Telfer of the Fair
Dodhead," "Johnnie Armstrong," and "the Raid of the
Reidswire"&mdash;and if you ever chance to be traveling
between Hawick and Carlisle you can look out of the
window, as the train carries you swiftly down Liddesdale,
and people the hillsides, in your imagination, with companies
of reivers setting out to harry their "auld enemies",
the English.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NEW_WONDERLAND" id="THE_NEW_WONDERLAND">THE NEW WONDERLAND</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>You have probably, like Betty, the little girl in this story,
read "Alice in Wonderland". If you haven't, you will find
out, before you have read very far on this page, when Alice lived.
Glance at the first part of the story and see.</p>

<p>Alice, in the book that Betty had been reading, had wonderful
adventures in a strange country, where rabbits and caterpillars
talked, and where certain kinds of cake made you grow taller
or shorter, and where people put pepper in tea. Anybody would
think a country like that was a Wonderland; but you will
see that Alice found our everyday, twentieth-century world is a
Wonderland, too. See if you can tell why she thought so.</p></blockquote>

<p>Betty laid down her book with a sigh. It had been a
lovely book, and she was sorry it was finished. "Such a
humdrum old world!" she said discontentedly. "I wish I
had a chance to go to Wonderland, like Alice."</p>

<p>"Why," said a voice from the doorway, "isn't this Wonderland,
then?"</p>

<p>Betty looked up, startled. She saw a little girl of about
her own age, with long, light, straight hair hanging to her
waist, with wide, wondering blue eyes, and dressed in the
simplest, most old-fashioned of little white frocks.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" inquired Betty.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know me? I'm Alice," said the quaint
little girl.</p>

<p>"How did you get here? I thought you lived a long
time ago, in 1850 or so."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I did begin to live then; but you see I've been
traveling in Wonderland so long that I've never had time
to grow up."</p>

<p>"Aren't you sorry to have come back to real life, and
begin to do lessons, and mind what the older people say,
and all?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but I haven't! Of course, I suppose the people
in Wonderland don't know they are queer, and so that's
why you don't know you live there."</p>

<p>"Well," said Betty scornfully, "I'm sure I don't see
anything to wonder at in this old place&mdash;" Just then a
bell rang sharply, and Betty hurried to answer the telephone.
It was her father speaking. She took his message
and returned to her guest.</p>

<p>"What in the world," said Alice, "made you talk into
that little black cup?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the telephone."</p>

<p>"What's a telephone? We didn't have them in my
time, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody has one now. It lets you talk to somebody
'way off, over an electric wire."</p>

<p>"Of course, we read about Franklin and his kite and all
that. Let me try it." But when the operator's voice
saying "Number, please?" came to Alice's ear, she was
so frightened that she dropped the receiver.</p>

<p>"I can show you lots more things we do with electricity,"
said Betty, beginning to understand that things which
were commonplace to her were wonders to her visitor.
"You see it's getting dark? Now watch." Going to the
push-button in the wall she snapped on the light; Alice
jumped at its suddenness.</p>

<p>"Why, at home we had to find matches and light a lamp,"
she said in amazement.</p>

<p>"That's nothing," said Betty. "Come along." She
led her new friend into the dining room, and showed her
how, by pressing a button, the rack could be heated for
toasting bread, or heat supplied for the coffee pot. Then
they went on into the kitchen, and she showed Alice the
gas stove, where a flame sprang into life at the turning of
a handle; and the washing-machine, where the pressing of
another button set the clothes to churning up and down
in the suds; and the electric iron, heated by the pressing
of still another button.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Betty Showed Her the Victrola</span></p>

<p>"Why, nobody needs to do any work at all," said Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
admiringly, while Betty began to feel that after all she had
a great many remarkable things in her house, which she
had never thought much about because they had always
been there. As they walked back into the hall, they
heard a click-clicking sound.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just my big brother's wireless apparatus catching
a message. If he were here he could tell us what it says."</p>

<p>"What's a wireless?"</p>

<p>"Why, you don't know anything much, do you?"
Betty explained as well as she could about the wireless
telegraph.</p>

<p>"Goodness! That's like real magic. You must feel as
if you were living in a fairy story."</p>

<p>Betty had never thought of life in that way, and was
about to tell Alice how really dull a time she had, when
a sound of music interrupted them.</p>

<p>"Oh, how lovely! Somebody's singing!"</p>

<p>"No, you little goose, that's only the victrola," answered
Betty.</p>

<p>"What's a victrola?"</p>

<p>Betty tried to explain that it was a machine that caught
and imprisoned somebody's voice or the music of some
instrument. But Alice couldn't understand. Even when
Betty showed her the victrola, and the record, she could
hardly believe that a real singer wasn't hidden somewhere
making fun of her.</p>

<p>While she was still unpersuaded, Betty heard her father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
key in the lock. She knew the car must still be before the
door.</p>

<p>"Father, father," she cried, "this is Alice&mdash;from Wonderland,
you know. Won't you take us for a ride?"</p>

<p>"A little one," said Betty's father. Alice clapped her
hands, for she loved to go driving. But when the two little
girls were safely seated in the back seat, she began to
wonder again.</p>

<p>"Where are the horses?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Horses! Why, it's an automobile."</p>

<p>"What's an automobile?"</p>

<p>"Why, a carriage that runs of itself." The car started,
and Alice understood without further explaining. She
couldn't ask any more questions, because the rapid motion
quite took away her breath.</p>

<p>Betty asked Alice to spend the night with her, and
promised that next morning she would take her to town
and show her some more of the sights of the New Wonderland.
She went to sleep feeling that after all it wasn't
such a humdrum world, and that she had taken for granted
a great many things that, when you came to think of it,
really made life a fairy tale, and the world Wonderland.</p>

<p>Bristol, a cathedral city of England, situated partly in
Gloucestershire, partly in Somersetshire, but forming a
county in itself. In 1911 it had a population of 357,059.
It stands at the confluence of the rivers Avon and Frome,
which unite within the city whence the combined stream
(the Avon) pursues a course of nearly seven miles to the
Bristol Channel. The Avon is a navigable river, and
the tides rise in it to a great height. The town is built
partly on low grounds, partly on eminences, and has some
fine suburban districts, such as Clifton, on the opposite
side of the Avon, connected with Bristol by a suspension
bridge 703 feet long and 245 feet above high-water
mark. The public buildings are numerous and handsome,
and the number of places of worship very great.
The most notable of these are the cathedral, founded in
1142, exhibiting various styles of architecture, and recently
restored and enlarged; St. Mary Redcliff, said to have
been founded in 1293, and perhaps the finest parish church
in the kingdom. Among modern buildings are the exchange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the guild-hall, the council house, the post office, the new
grammar school, the fine arts academy, the West of England,
and other banks, insurance offices, etc. The charities are
exceedingly numerous, the most important being Ashley
Down Orphanage, for the orphans of Protestant parents,
founded and still managed by the Rev. George Müller,
which may almost be described as a village of orphans.
Among the educational institutions are the University College,
the Theological Colleges of the Baptists and Independents,
Clifton College, and the Philosophical Institute. There
is a school of art, and also a public library. Bristol has
glassworks, potteries, soap works, tanneries, sugar refineries,
and chemical works, shipbuilding and machinery yards.
Coal is worked extensively within the limits of the borough.
The export and import trade is large and varied, it being
one of the leading English ports in the foreign trade. Regular
navigation across the Atlantic was first established here, and
the <i>Great Western</i>, the pioneer steamship in this route, was
built here. There is a harbor in the city itself, and the
construction of new docks at Avonmouth and Portishead
has given a fresh impetus to the port. The construction of
very large new docks was begun in 1902. Bristol is one
of the healthiest of the large towns of the kingdom. It has
an excellent water supply chiefly obtained from the Mendip
Hills.&mdash;In old Celtic chronicles we find the name <i>Caer Oder</i>,
or "the City of the Chasm", given to a place in this neighborhood,
a name peculiarly appropriate to the situation of
Bristol, or rather of its suburb Clifton. The Saxons called
it <i>Bricgstow</i>, "bridge-place". In 1373 it was constituted a
county of itself by Edward III. It was made the seat of a
bisphoric by Henry VIII in 1542 (now united with Gloucester).
Sebastian Cabot, Chatterton, and Southey were
natives of Bristol.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_HAPPY_PRINCE" id="THE_HAPPY_PRINCE">THE HAPPY PRINCE</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is a story of a golden statue and a little bird, both of
whom sacrificed a great deal for the sake of others. As you
read, see if you can tell which sacrificed more, and decide
whether you are sorry for them because they gave up so much.</p></blockquote>

<p>High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue
of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin
leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires,
and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>One night, there flew over the city a little Swallow.
His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but
he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most
beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he
was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had
been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped
to talk to her.</p>

<p>After the other swallows had gone he felt lonely, and began
to tire of his lady-love. "She has no conversation," he
said, "and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is
always flirting with the wind." And certainly, whenever
the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtsies.
"I admit that she is domestic," he continued, "but I love
traveling, and my wife, consequently, should love traveling
also."</p>

<p>"Will you come away with me?" he said finally to her;
but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her
home.</p>

<p>"You have been trifling with me," he cried. "I am off to
the Pyramids. Good-bye!" and he flew away.</p>

<p>All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the
city. "Where shall I put up?" he said. "I hope the town
has made preparations."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he saw the statue on the tall column. "I will put
up there," he cried; "it is a fine position, with plenty of
fresh air." So he alighted just between the feet of the
Happy Prince.</p>

<p>"I have a golden bedroom," he said softly to himself as
he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just
as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of
water fell on him.</p>

<p>"What a curious thing!" he cried, "there is not a
single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright,
and yet it is raining. The climate in the north of Europe
is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that
was merely her selfishness."</p>

<p>Then another drop fell.</p>

<p>"What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain
off?" he said; "I must look for a good chimney-pot,"
and he determined to fly away.</p>

<p>But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell,
and he looked up, and saw&mdash;Ah! what did he see?</p>

<p>The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and
tears were running down his golden cheeks. His face was
so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was
filled with pity.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he said.</p>

<p>"I am the Happy Prince."</p>

<p>"Why are you weeping then?" asked the swallow;
"you have quite drenched me."</p>

<p>"When I was alive and had a human heart," answered
the statue, "I did not know what tears were, for I lived in
the Palace of Sans-Souci (without care), where sorrow is
not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my
companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance
in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty
wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything
about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me
the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be
happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I
am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see
all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though
my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose but weep."</p>

<p>"What, is he not of solid gold?" said the Swallow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
himself. He was too polite to make any personal remarks
out loud.</p>

<p>"Far away," continued the statue in a low musical voice,
"far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of
the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman
seated at the table. Her face is thin and worn, and she
has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a
seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin
gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of-honor to
wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the
room her little boy is lying ill. He has a fever, and is
asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him
but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little
Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword
hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot
move."</p>

<p>"I am waited for in Egypt," said the Swallow. "My
friends are flying up and down the Nile and talking to the
large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb
of the great King. The King is there himself in his painted
coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with
spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and
his hands are like withered leaves."</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince,
"will you not stay with me for one night, and be my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
messenger? The boy is so thirsty and the mother is so
sad."</p>

<p>"I don't think I like boys," answered the Swallow.
"Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were
two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing
stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows
fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family
famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect."</p>

<p>But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little
Swallow was sorry. "It is very cold here," he said; "but
I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger."</p>

<p>"Thank you, little Swallow," said the Prince.</p>

<p>So the Swallow picked out the ruby from the Prince's
sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of
the town.</p>

<p>He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble
angels were sculptured. He passed by the palace and
heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on
the balcony with her lover. "How wonderful the stars
are," he said to her, "and how wonderful is the power of
love!" "I hope my dress will be ready in time for the
State-ball," she answered; "I have ordered passion-flowers
to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy."</p>

<p>He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging
to the masts of the ships. At last he came to the poor
house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on
his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.
In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside
the woman's thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed,
fanning the boy's forehead with his wings. "How cool I
feel," said the boy, "I must be getting better;" and he
sank into a delicious slumber.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
told him what he had done. "It is curious," he remarked,
"but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold."</p>

<p>"That is because you have done a good action," said the
Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and then
fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.</p>

<p>When day broke he flew down to the river and had a
bath. "To-night I go to Egypt," he said, and he was in
high spirits at the prospect. He visited all the public
monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple.
Wherever he went sparrows chirruped, and said to each
other, "What a distinguished stranger!" so he enjoyed
himself very much.</p>

<p>When the moon rose he flew back and said to the Happy
Prince: "Have you any commissions for Egypt? I am
just starting."</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince,
"will you not stay with me one night longer? Far away
across the city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning
over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his
side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is brown
and crisp and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has
large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for
the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any
more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made
him faint."</p>

<p>"I will wait one night longer," said the Swallow, who
had a good heart. "Shall I take him another ruby?"</p>

<p>"Alas! I have no ruby now," said the Prince; "my
eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare
sapphires which were brought out of India a thousand
years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He
will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and
finish his play."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear Prince," said the Swallow, "I cannot do that";
and he began to weep.</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "do
as I command you."</p>

<p>So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew
away to the student's garret. It was easy enough to get
in, as there was a hole in the roof. Through this he darted,
and came into the room. The young man had his head
buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the
bird's wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful
sapphire lying on the withered violets.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to be appreciated," he cried; "this is
from some great admirer. Now I can finish my play,"
and he looked quite happy.</p>

<p>The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbor. He
sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors
hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. "I am
going to Egypt!" cried the Swallow, but nobody minded,
and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.</p>

<p>"I am come to bid you good-bye," he cried.</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince,
"will you not stay with me one night longer?"</p>

<p>"It is winter," answered the Swallow, "and the chill snow
will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the green
palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily
about them."</p>

<p>"In the square below," said the Happy Prince, "there
stands a little match-girl. She has let her matches fall in
the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father will beat
her if she does not bring home some money, and she is
crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head
is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and
her father will not beat her."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will stay with you one night longer," said the Swallow,
"but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite
blind then."</p>

<p>"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince,
"do as I command you."</p>

<p>So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted
down with it. He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped
the jewel into the palm of her hand. "What a lovely bit
of glass," cried the little girl; and she ran home laughing.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. "You are
blind now," he said, "so I will stay with you always."</p>

<p>"No, little Swallow," said the poor Prince, "you must
go away to Egypt."</p>

<p>"I will stay with you always," said the Swallow, and he
slept at the Prince's feet.</p>

<p>Next day the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw
the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the
beggars were sitting at the gates. He flew into dark lanes,
and saw the white faces of starving children looking out
listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a
bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms
to try and keep themselves warm.</p>

<p>Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.</p>

<p>"I am covered with fine gold," said the Prince, "you must
take it off leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living
always think that gold can make them happy."</p>

<p>Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off,
till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf
after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the
children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played
games in the street. "We have bread now!" they cried.</p>

<p>Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.
The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal
daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody
went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet
caps and skated on the ice.</p>

<p>The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he
would not leave the Prince, for he loved him too well.
He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door, and tried
to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.</p>

<p>But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had
just enough strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once
more. "Good-bye, dear Prince!" he murmured, "will you
let me kiss your hand?"</p>

<p>"I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little
Swallow," said the Prince, "you have stayed too long here;
but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you."</p>

<p>"It is not to Egypt that I am going," said the Swallow.
"I am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother
of Sleep, is he not?"</p>

<p>And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell
down dead at his feet.</p>

<p>At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the
statue as if something had broken. The fact is that the
leaden heart had snapped right in two. It certainly was
a dreadfully hard frost.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the
square below in company with the Town Councillors.
As they passed the column he looked up at the statue:
"Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!" he
said.</p>

<p>"How shabby indeed!" cried the Town Councillors,
who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to
look at it.</p>

<p>"The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and he is golden no longer," said the Mayor; "in fact
he is little better than a beggar."</p>

<p>"Little better than a beggar," said the Town Councillors.</p>

<p>"And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!" continued
the Mayor. "We must really issue a proclamation that
birds are not to be allowed to die here." And the Town
Clerk made a note of the suggestion.</p>

<p>So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.
"As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful," said
the Art Professor at the University.</p>

<p>Then they melted the statue in a furnace and the Mayor
held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to
be done with the metal. "We must have another statue,
of course," he said, "and it shall be a statue of myself."</p>

<p>"Of myself," said each of the Town Councillors, and they
quarreled. When I last heard of them they were quarreling
still.</p>

<p>"What a strange thing!" said the overseer at the foundry.
"This broken lead heart will not melt in the
furnace. We must throw it away." So they threw it on
a dust heap where the dead swallow was also lying.</p>

<p>"Bring me the two most precious things in the city,"
said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him
the leaden heart and the dead bird.</p>

<p>"You have rightly chosen," said God, "for in my garden
of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in
my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me."</p>

a good sentence: <span class="smcap">John is a boy's name.</span> This sentence
is true. In the same way, the words <span class="smcap">books made iron of are</span>,
in this order do not make a good sentence, but arranged in
the right order they form a good sentence: <span class="smcap">Books are made

<p>3. Here are ten groups of words which can be rearranged
into good sentences. When they are rearranged in their right
order, some will be true and some will be false. Look at the
first set of words. Do not write the words in their right order,
but see what they would say if rearranged. If what they

<blockquote><p>You should all begin reading at the same moment. Your

<p>Maybe you had a big brother or sister or cousin or aunt or

such letters as this one, which a big sister wrote to her little
brothers in America. As you read, see if you do not think
she must be a very pleasant, friendly big sister, not only to her
own little brothers, but also to the little French children.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you wish you had been born in France and that your
names were Jean, and René, and Etienne instead of Bill
and George Albert and Ben? And do you wish you wore
black sateen aprons instead of woolly blue sweaters?</p>

<p>The reason I began to write you this letter is that yesterday
afternoon I put on my hat and coat when I ought to
have been working, and went to visit some French schools.
I went with twenty fine people who all wore Red Cross
uniforms.</p>

<p>The reason I went is very interesting. For three years,
while all the men and the big boys in France have been
fighting, their mothers and sisters and all the children
whom they had to leave behind them have been getting
poorer and thinner and hungrier. You see, since the men
have gone to war there haven't been enough of them left
to grow the wheat and run the machinery which makes the
bread. Well, as I said, the mothers and the little children
got thinner and poorer and hungrier, but the last thing of
all that they gave up was a luncheon they served in the
afternoon in the schools to the smallest and poorest children.
It was such a little luncheon that they called it "the taste",<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
but finally they had to give up even that; and then when
the time came to eat, the children, who were just as brave
as soldiers, had to pretend they weren't hungry at all.
They went without that luncheon for a number of months,
and then an American doctor decided that the boys and
girls in that part of Paris must have that luncheon again.
So the doctor rented a bakeshop and he got a ton of nice
white American flour, and hundreds and hundreds of cans
of American condensed milk, and a very great deal of sugar
and some other things, and went to work making buns.
And the reason I went to the schools yesterday was to help
give out the buns and chocolate for the children's "taste".</p>

<p>I suppose you think that one bun and one piece of chocolate
wasn't much&mdash;and we thought so too when we saw
all those hungry little faces, and their little legs that looked
quite hollow&mdash;but the children thought it was fine. They
were so polite, boys! When we marched into their classrooms
they all stood up and saluted us as if they had been
soldiers. They showed us their copy books and told us
what the lesson was. In one class the master himself was
quite scared because he wanted to speak English to make
us feel at home. But he made us a fine speech, saying
how thankful they all were to their American friends for
being so generous to them. He thanked us especially for
thinking of the children and for trying to help them when
their fathers were away fighting. Then he asked the
boys whose fathers or brothers were in the war to raise
their hands, and, do you know, almost every boy could
raise his hand. They were proud to do it, too. Their
hands went up quickly and some of them waved&mdash;as you
do when you especially want the teacher to pay attention
to you. The master asked the boys whose fathers
would never come back to raise their hands, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
were so many of them that we could hardly bear to count
them; and this time the hands went up very slowly and
their faces were very, very sober.</p>

<p>In the first school we went to, the big hall was decorated
with a long string of American flags. Every one was drawn
very carefully, and then colored with crayons by the
littlest children. There were paper chains, too, made out
of red, white, and blue paper; and finally, when the buns
came in, the baskets were all decorated with the American
flag because the American people had given the bread.</p>

<p>The boys all marched into the hall in a long, long line,
and, Bill and Junior and Ben, I was so afraid that there
wouldn't be enough buns to go around! They marched up
to the baskets, their little wooden shoes making a terrible
clatter on the stone floor; and every boy got a bun in one
hand and a bar of chocolate in the other, and every boy
said "Thank you" in French, very politely. I don't think
even the smallest forgot that, though some of them were
so excited that they couldn't march straight and some of
them couldn't talk at all plainly, even in French. There
was one time when I got very much excited myself. That
was when one little boy, in a blue soldier suit just like his
father's, said "Thank you" in English. I nearly dropped
all the buns I had in my two hands, I was so surprised.</p>

<p>The Mayor of the district, who probably seemed like the
President of the United States to most of the children, made
a speech and told them how sorry the Americans had been
that they couldn't have their lunch in the afternoon, and
how the Americans wanted them to be strong and well and
happy and had given them the buns and the chocolate to
help, and he talked to them in such a pleasant voice and in
such a loving sort of way, that when he said he wanted them
to shout, "Vive l'Amerique!" which means, "Hurrah for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the United States of America!" they shouted&mdash;really and
truly shouted&mdash;just as if they'd been little American boys.</p>

<p>At the next school, we went to the building where the
tiniest children of all learned their kindergarten games.
They marched for us, and sang a little song about the good
"Saint Christopher", who was kind to little children; and
a little boy who had lost his mother and father in the war
and who was really too little to understand, said a very
polite speech to us and promised us that he and his little
friends would always remember how kind the Americans
had been to them. He was so tiny that he hid his head in
the teacher's apron when he had finished.</p>

<p>Finally we went to the biggest school of all, and there
we found a great hall filled with classes of little girls, all
dressed in black, all looking so pale and thin and sad that
we were glad to think that perhaps the buns and chocolates
we had brought would&mdash;in a month or two&mdash;bring some
color into their poor little faces, and perhaps even put some
fat on their wrists and hands that were so thin they seemed
like birds' claws. One of the older girls had made a fine
big panel picture here showing the children eating their buns
and chocolates and capering up and down just as I've seen
somebody caper a bit when he was going to have&mdash;was it
ice cream for Sunday dinner?</p>

<p>At the end, the nice old Mayor made another speech, in
which he told us a little bit of how brave the children had
been when they were hungry, and how glad he was that they
were now going to have the American food, and then he
thanked us all over again. So, then, one of the American
doctors said that when we came over here to France with
our men, our food, and our love, we weren't making gifts, we
were just trying to pay the debt that America had owed
to France since Lafayette and his men came across the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to help us in our war. Then the doctor told us how the
Arabs believe that people who once eat even a tiny
piece of bread together will always be friends, so the little
children and their teachers, and the nice old Mayor, and
all the Americans from the Red Cross ate some of the
American buns and&mdash;that is the end of the story!</p>

<p>Dear Sisters: I have just received your letter. I am much
touched by your kindness to me, and for your generous hearts.
I am contented to find among you so many devoted new
sisters for the poor orphan of this unfortunate war, which has
killed all our fathers. Dear Sisters, I don't want you to see a

not speak any more about it; that gives too much trouble.</p>

<p>You ask me of what I have the greatest need; indeed,
that will be a dress if that is possible for you; for mamma
does not want us to abuse your good hearts. The dress,
I should like to see it dark blue, for up to now I have always
worn black and white. Mamma permits me now to wear
blue, and I think that will be becoming.</p>

<p>Mamma has made little economies of money. She is
going to have my photograph taken, and I am going to
send them. I think that will give you pleasure, and I will
write to you often. I do not forget you in my morning and

travelled far enough to see nearly all the places he dreamed
of. He did not travel just for pleasure, however; his health
was so poor that he wandered all over the world to find a
climate where he could live. The place he found was an island
in the Southern Pacific, one of a group called Samoa, where
he spent all the last years of his life. Stevenson was a man
who made friends wherever he went. In Samoa the natives
loved him dearly. Their name for him was Tusitala, "the

<h2><a name="RULES_FOR_USING_THE_EYES" id="RULES_FOR_USING_THE_EYES">RULES FOR USING THE EYES</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Read the following rules through once; then cover the page
with a sheet of paper, and answer the questions.</p></blockquote>

<p>1. When reading, writing, or doing other close work, be
sure to have good, clear light, preferably over the left
shoulder if writing, and not directly in the eyes nor reflected
sharply from the paper.</p>

<p>2. Do not hold your work less than 12 inches from your
eyes.</p>

<p>3. Do not use the eyes too long continuously&mdash;rest them
a few minutes occasionally by closing them or by looking
into the distance to relax them. One should do this at least
every hour, especially if reading fine type or doing intense,
delicate work.</p>

<p>4. Keep away from places where stone chips, sparks,
or emery dust is flying. If you have to work where such

the game at all nor why his master should have
become so lazy. Suddenly, Tom jumped up and, pulling

in some miraculous manner grown to $14.50.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

down great books in which were written all the laws of the
kingdom. They traced through long pages with trembling
fingers and anxious, frowning eyes. At the end of each
page they would shake their heads and mutter among
themselves, and as they closed the last ponderous volume
they approached the king with many gestures of despair.
"We cannot find an answer written in all the Books of the

<p>5. I saw some one drawing slowly near along the road.
He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick,
and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose; and
he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a
large, old, tattered sea-cloak with a hood, that made him
appear positively deformed. I never saw a more dreadful
looking figure. He stopped a little from the inn, and raising
his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed the air in front
of him.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BROKEN_FLOWER-POT" id="THE_BROKEN_FLOWER-POT">THE BROKEN FLOWER-POT</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Is this a real, live boy who tells this story? He did two
things, a bad one and a good one. You probably would not
have done the bad one. Try to think out for yourself, not to
answer the question to your teacher or class, whether or not
you would have done the good one.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>My father was seated on the lawn before the house, his
straw hat over his eyes, and his book on his lap. Suddenly
a beautiful delft blue-and-white flower-pot, which had been
set on the window-sill of an upper story, fell to the ground
with a crash, and the fragments flew up round my father's
feet. But my father continued to read.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" cried my mother, who was at work in
the porch; "my poor flower-pot, that I prized so much!
I would rather the best tea-set were broken! The poor
geranium I reared myself, and the dear, dear flower-pot
which Mr. Caxton bought for me my last birthday! That
naughty child must have done this!"</p>

<p>I came out of the house as bold as brass, and said rapidly,
"Yes, mother, it was I who pushed out the flower-pot."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said my nurse, while gazing at my father, who
had very slowly taken off his hat, and was looking on with
serious, wide-awake eyes. "Hush! And if he did break it,
ma'am, it was quite an accident. He was standing so,
and he never meant it. Did you? Speak!" this in a
whisper, "or father will be so very angry."</p>

<p>"Well," said mother, "I suppose it was an accident; take
care in the future, my child. You are sorry, I see, to have
grieved me. There is a kiss; don't fret."</p>

<p>"No, mother, you must not kiss me; I don't deserve it,
I pushed out the flower-pot on purpose."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! and why?" said my father, walking up.</p>

<p>"For fun!" said I, hanging my head; "just to see how
you'd look, father; and that's the truth of it."</p>

<p>My father threw his book fifty feet off, stooped down,
and caught me in his arms. "Boy," he said, "you have
done wrong; you shall repair it by remembering all your
life that your father blessed God for giving him a son who
spoke truth in spite of fear."</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Not long after, Mr. Squills gave me a beautiful large
box of dominoes, made of cut ivory. This domino box
was my delight. I was never tired of playing at dominoes
with my old nurse, and I slept with the box under my pillow.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said my father one day when he found me arranging
the ivory pieces in the parlor, "do you like that better
than all your playthings?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, father!"</p>

<p>"You would be very sorry if mother were to throw that
box out of the window and break it, for fun." I looked
pleadingly at my father, and made no answer. "But
perhaps you would be very glad," he went on, "if suddenly
one of those good fairies you read of could change the
domino box into a beautiful geranium in a lovely blue-and-white
flower-pot. Then you could have the pleasure of
putting it on mother's window-sill."</p>

<p>"Indeed I would," said I, half crying.</p>

<p>"My dear boy, I believe you; but good <i>wishes</i> do not
mend bad actions; good <i>actions</i> mend bad actions." So
saying he shut the door and went out.</p>

<p>"My boy," said he the next day, "I am going to walk
to town; will you come? And, by the by, fetch your
domino box; I should like to show it to a person there."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father," said I by the way, "there are no fairies now
how then can my domino box be changed into a geranium
in a blue-and-white flower-pot?"</p>

<p>"My dear," said my father, leaning his hand on my
shoulder, "everybody who is in earnest to be good, carries
two fairies about with him&mdash;one here," and he touched my
forehead, "and one there," and he touched my heart.</p>

<p>"I don't understand, father."</p>

<p>"I can wait until you do, my son."</p>

<p>My father stopped at a nursery-gardener's, and after
looking over the flowers, paused before a large geranium.
"Ah, this is finer than that which your mother was so fond
of. What is the price of this, sir?"</p>

<p>"Only seven and six pence," said the gardener. My
father buttoned up his pocket.</p>

<p>"I can't afford it to-day," said he gently, and we walked
out.</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>On entering the town we stopped again at a china warehouse.
"Have you a flower-pot like that I bought some
months ago? Ah, here is one, marked three and six pence.
Yes, that is the price. Well, when mother's birthday
comes again, we must buy her another. That is some months
to wait. And we can wait, my boy. For truth, that blooms
all the year round, is better than a poor geranium; and a
word that is never broken is better than a piece of delft."</p>

<p>My head, which had been drooping before, rose again;
but the rush of joy at my heart almost stifled me. "I have
called to pay your bill," said my father, entering a shop.</p>

<p>"And, by the by," he added, "my boy can show you a
beautiful domino box." I produced my treasure, and the
shopman praised it highly. "It is always well, my boy,
to know what a thing is worth, in case one wishes to part
with it. If my son gets tired of his plaything, what will
you give him for it?"</p>

eighteen shillings for it."</p>

<p>"Eighteen shillings!" said my father; "you would give
that? Well, my boy, whenever you do grow tired of your
box, you have my leave to sell it."</p>

<p>My father paid his bill, and went out. I lingered behind
a few moments, and joined him at the end of the street.</p>

<p>"Father, father!" I cried, clapping my hands, "we can
buy the geranium; we can buy the flower-pot!" And I
pulled a handful of silver from my pocket.</p>

<p>"Did I not say right?" said my father. "You have
found the two fairies!"</p>

<p>Ah, how proud, how overjoyed I was, when after placing
vase and flower on the window-sill, I plucked my mother
by the gown, and made her follow me to the spot.</p>

actions have mended the bad."</p>

<h2><a name="SAINT_GEORGE_AND_THE_DRAGON" id="SAINT_GEORGE_AND_THE_DRAGON">SAINT GEORGE AND THE DRAGON</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is the story of the greatest deed of the patron, or
guardian, saint of England. As you read the story, try to
remember how the young men of England, France, and America
showed themselves worthy followers of this brave, noble
knight.</p></blockquote>

<p>Long ago, when the knights lived in the land, there was
one knight whose name was Sir George. He was not only
braver than all the rest, but he was so noble, kind, and good
that the people came to call him Saint George.</p>

<p>No robbers ever dared to trouble the people who lived
near his castle, and all the wild animals were killed or
driven away, so the little children could play even in the
woods without being afraid.</p>

<p>One day St. George rode throughout the country.
Everywhere he saw the men busy at their work in the fields,
the women singing at work in their homes, and the little
children shouting at their play.</p>

<p>"These people are all safe and happy; they need me no
more," said St. George. "But somewhere perhaps there
is trouble and fear. There may be some place where little
children cannot play in safety; some woman may have
been carried away from her home; perhaps there are even
dragons left to be slain. Tomorrow I shall ride away and
never stop until I find work which only a knight can do."</p>

<p>Early the next morning St. George put on his helmet and
all his shining armor, and fastened his sword at his side.
Then he mounted his great black horse and rode out from
his castle gate. Down the steep, rough road he went,
sitting straight and tall, and looking brave and strong as a
knight should look. On through the little village at the
foot of the hill and out across the country he rode. Everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
he saw rich fields filled with waving grain; everywhere
there was peace and plenty.</p>

<p>He rode on and on until at last he came into a part of the
country he had never seen before. He noticed that there
were no men working in the fields. The houses which he
passed stood silent and empty. The grass along the roadside
was scorched as if a fire had passed over it. A field of
wheat was all trampled and burned.</p>

<p>St. George drew up his horse, and looked carefully about
him. Everywhere there was silence and desolation.
"What can be the dreadful thing which has driven all the
people from their homes? I must find out, and give them
help if I can," he said. But there was no one to ask, so
St. George rode forward until at last, far in the distance,
he saw the walls of a city. "Here surely I shall find some
one who can tell me the cause of all this," he said, so he
rode more swiftly toward the city.</p>

<p>Just then the great gate opened and St. George saw
crowds of people standing inside the wall. Some of them
were weeping; all of them seemed afraid. As St. George
watched, he saw a beautiful maiden dressed in white, with
a girdle of scarlet about her waist, pass through the gate
alone. The gate clanged shut, and the maiden walked
along the road, weeping bitterly. She did not see St.
George, who was riding quickly towards her.</p>

<p>"Maiden, why do you weep?" he asked as he reached
her side.</p>

<p>She looked up at St. George sitting there on his horse,
so straight and tall and beautiful. "Oh, Sir Knight!"
she cried, "ride quickly from this place. You know not
the danger you are in!"</p>

<p>"Danger!" said St. George; "do you think a knight
would flee from danger? Besides, you, a fair, weak girl,
are here alone. Think you a knight would leave you or
any woman so? Tell me your trouble that I may help you."</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">St. George Saw the Head of the Dragon Lifted from the Pool</span></p>

<p>"No! No!" she cried. "Hasten away. You would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
only lose your life. There is a terrible dragon near. He
may come at any moment. One breath would destroy you
if he found you here. Go! Go quickly!"</p>

<p>"Tell me more of this," said St. George sternly. "Why
are you here alone to meet this dragon? Are there no
men left in yon city?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the maiden, "my father, the king, is old and
feeble. He has only me to help him take care of his people.
This terrible dragon has driven them from their homes,
carried away their cattle, and ruined their crops. They
have all come within the walls of the city for safety. For
weeks now the dragon has come to the very gates of the
city. We have been forced to give him two sheep each day
for his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Yesterday there were no sheep left to give, so he said
that unless a young maiden were given him today he would
break down the walls and destroy the city. The people
cried to my father to save them, but he could do nothing.
I am going to give myself to the dragon. Perhaps if he
has me, the Princess, he may spare our people."</p>

<p>"Lead the way, brave Princess. Show me where this
monster may be found."</p>

<p>When the Princess saw St. George's flashing eyes and
great, strong arm as he drew forth his sword, she felt
afraid no more. Turning, she led the way to a shining
pool.</p>

<p>"There's where he stays," she whispered. "See, the
water moves. He is waking."</p>

<p>St. George saw the head of the dragon lifted from the
pool. Fold on fold he rose from the water. When he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
St. George he gave a roar of rage and plunged toward him.
The smoke and flames flew from his nostrils, and he opened
his great jaws as if to swallow both the knight and his
horse.</p>

<p>St. George shouted and, waving his sword above his
head, rode at the dragon. Quick and hard came the blows
from St. George's sword. It was a terrible battle.</p>

<p>At last the dragon was wounded. He roared with pain
and plunged at St. George, opening his great mouth close
to the brave Knight's head.</p>

<p>St. George looked carefully, then struck with all his
strength straight down through the dragon's throat, and
he fell at the horse's feet&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>Then St. George shouted for joy at his victory. He
called to the Princess. She came and stood beside him.</p>

<p>"Give me the girdle from about your waist, O Princess,"
said St. George.</p>

<p>The Princess gave him her girdle and St. George bound
it around the dragon's neck, and they pulled the dragon
after them by that little silken ribbon back to the city so
that all of the people could see that the dragon could never
harm them again.</p>

<p>When they saw St. George bringing the Princess back in
safety and knew that the dragon was slain, they threw open
the gates of the city and sent up great shouts of joy. The
King heard them and came out from his palace to see why
the people were shouting. When he saw his daughter safe
he was the happiest of them all. "O brave Knight,"
he said, "I am old and weak. Stay here and help me
guard my people from harm."</p>

<p>"I'll stay as long as ever you have need of me," St.
George answered. So he lived in the palace and helped
the old King take care of his people, and when the old King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
died, St. George was made King in his stead. The people
felt happy and safe so long as they had such a brave and
good man for their King.</p>

<h2><a name="ROOSEVELTS_FAVORITE_STUDY" id="ROOSEVELTS_FAVORITE_STUDY">ROOSEVELT'S FAVORITE STUDY</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>You should all begin to read this story at the same moment.</p>

<p>At the end of five minutes you will be asked to close your
books and follow your teacher's directions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Very often the things that a boy or girl likes to do as a
child are signs of what he or she will like to do as a man or
woman. This is true in the case of Theodore Roosevelt.
One of the subjects in which he was all his life most interested
was his favorite study as a boy. It seems that he
was not an unusually clever student in his early years.
In Latin and Greek and mathematics he was poor; in
science and history and geography he made better progress;
but best of all he loved natural history&mdash;the study of animals.</p>

<p>His first experience in this study befell him when he
was nine years old. He was walking past one of the city
markets one day, when he saw a dead seal lying on a slab
of wood. He had just been reading about seals, and it
seemed a wonderful thing to see a real one. He became
possessed with a longing to own the seal. Being unable
to form any plan for satisfying that longing, he contented
himself with visiting the market day by day to gaze upon
the object which proved so interesting to him. He took
the seal's measurements carefully with a folding pocket
rule and had considerable difficulty when he came to
measuring its girth. Somehow or other he got the animal's
skull, and with it he and two of his cousins immediately
founded what they called the "Roosevelt Museum of
Natural History". At the same time his observations
of the seal and the measurements which he had made of
it were carefully set down in a blank book.</p>

<p>In another blank book were recorded further observations
in natural history. This work was entitled, "Natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
History on Insects, by Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.," and
began in this fashion: "All these insects are native of
North America. Most of the insects are not in other books.
I will write about ants first."</p>

<p>The beginning of the treatise on ants is entertaining, if
not deeply scientific. "Ants," he writes, "are di<i>fi</i>ded
into three sorts for every species. These kinds are officer,
soilder [soldier?] and worker. There are about one officer
to ten soilders and one soilder to two workers." The book
then went on to describe other insects which he had observed,
all of which he assured the reader "inhabit North
America". At the end of the volume on insects were a few
notes on fishes. Among these was a description of the
crayfish. "I need not describe the form of the crayfish
to you," wrote the young author; "look at the lobster and
you have its form." These observations, recorded at the
age of nine years, are worth mentioning because they show
a real interest in the creatures of which he was writing.</p>

<p>When Theodore was thirteen, his father sent him to a
little shop to take lessons in taxidermy, the stuffing and
mounting of animals. Then the boy wanted to secure his
own specimens; so his father gave him a gun for that
purpose. When he first tried to use this gun, he was puzzled
to find that he could not see the objects at which his companions
were shooting. One day some boys with him read
aloud an advertisement written in huge letters on a billboard
some distance away, and Theodore then realized,
for the first time, that there must be something the matter
with his eyes because he could not see the letters. His
father soon got him a pair of spectacles, which, he says,
opened up a new world to him.</p>

<p>When he was fourteen the family went to Europe, and,
among other expeditions, took a trip up the Nile. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
they started on this trip. Theodore picked up in Cairo a
book which contained some account of the birds of that
region. Armed with this book and with the gun which his
father had given him, he secured a number of specimens
of birds in Egypt.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the rest of the family, Theodore
insisted on carrying his natural history specimens about
with him from place to place. One day when the family
was in Vienna, his brother Elliot inquired plaintively of
their father whether it would be possible that he should
now and then have a room to himself in the hotels, instead
of being obliged always to share one with Theodore. Mr.
Roosevelt was perfectly willing to comply, but inquired the
reason for Elliot's request. Elliot said, "Come and see our
room, and you will understand." When they reached the
boys' room, they found bottles of taxidermist's supplies
everywhere, and in the basin the remains of specimens which
Theodore had lately captured. Theodore himself records
the fact that he was "grubby". "I suppose," he says,
"that all growing boys tend to be grubby; but the small
boy with the taste for natural history is generally the
very grubbiest of all."</p>

<h2><a name="WHAT_A_CHIMNEY_IS" id="WHAT_A_CHIMNEY_IS">WHAT A CHIMNEY IS</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Probably you think you can tell all about a chimney, but
you may be able to learn something interesting from this
selection.</p>

<p>You should all begin reading at the same time. Your teacher
will give the signal when to close your books. She will then

<p>A hollow tree was the first chimney of our unlettered
forefathers. Accidentally set on fire, this tree illustrated
the principle upon which all chimneys have been constructed.
It showed that warm air, being lighter than cold
air, tends to rise. When this warm air is confined within
an enclosure open at the top and bottom, a strong upward
current fills the space. As the warm air rises, the cold air
rushes in through the opening at the bottom of the shaft,
and in this way a draft is created which supplies the fire
at the foot of the chimney with the oxygen it needs to support
combustion.</p>

<p>Simple chimneys are constructed of logs and mortar, or
of stones and mortar, such as those built for log cabins; of
brick, also of cement and of iron pipes made for the purpose.
Since a long column of hot air produces a stronger
current than a short one, the tallest chimneys, other things
being equal, produce the strongest draft. Tall chimneys
are larger at the base than at the top. This is to make the
structure stable and to increase the draft by contracting
the flue at the top. At the bottom the chimney is usually
connected with the fire by a flue. A fireplace, however, is
practically an enlarged part of the chimney.</p>

<p>The size and height of a chimney depend upon the size
of the furnace. For larger furnaces there is greater danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of making the flue too small than too large. The stacks or
chimneys of the largest steamships like the Mauritania
and the Imperator are so large that two railway trains could
run through them abreast, and they are about 175 feet in
length. The difference between a chimney and a smokestack
is in name only; chimneys constructed of tubing made
from iron plates are usually called stacks.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANKLIN_WRITES_FOR_THE_NEWSPAPER" id="FRANKLIN_WRITES_FOR_THE_NEWSPAPER">FRANKLIN WRITES FOR THE NEWSPAPER</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is Benjamin Franklin's own account of his first attempt
at writing. You see, he did not have a chance to learn to write,
as you do, by practice in composition in school.</p></blockquote>

<p>My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper.
It was the second that appeared in America, and
was called the "New England Courant". The only one
before it was the "Boston News-Letter". I remember his
being <i>dissuaded</i> by some of his friends from the undertaking,
as not likely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their
judgment, enough for America. At this time (1771) there
are not less than five and twenty. He went on, however,
with the undertaking; and after having worked in composing
the types and printing off the sheets, I was employed
to carry the papers through the streets to the customers.</p>

<p>He had some ingenious men among his friends, who
amused themselves by writing little pieces for this paper,
which gained it credit and made it more in demand; and
these gentlemen often visited us. Hearing their conversations,
and their accounts of the <i>approbation</i> their papers
were received with, I was excited to try my hand among
them; but being still a boy, and suspecting that my
brother would object to printing anything of mine in his
paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to <i>disguise</i> my
hand; and, writing an <i>anonymous</i> paper, I put it in at
night under the door of the printing-house. It was found
in the morning and communicated to his writing friends
when they called in as usual. They read it, and commented
on it in my hearing; and I had the <i>exquisite</i> pleasure of
finding it met with their approbation, and that in their
different guesses at the author, none were named but men
of some <i>character</i> among us for learning and <i>ingenuity</i>. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
suppose now that I was rather lucky in my judges and that
perhaps they were not really so very good ones as I then
<i>esteemed</i> them.</p>

<p>Encouraged, however, by this, I wrote and conveyed
in the same way to the press several more papers which
were equally approved; and I kept my secret till my small
fund of sense for such performances was pretty well
exhausted, and then I <i>discovered</i> it, when I began to be
considered a little more by my brother's acquaintance, and
in a manner that did not quite please him, as he thought,
probably with reason, that it tended to make me too vain.</p>

<p>Did you ever think how hard it would be to get along
without clocks? At almost every city street corner we
can look at a clock; every railway station, every post
office, every schoolhouse, has at least one; and everybody's
house contains one or more. And at that, boys and girls
are sometimes late for school.</p>

<p>No, we certainly couldn't manage without these useful
mechanisms; and yet, there was a time, not so many
centuries ago, either, when they were a rare possession;
and a time before that when they had not yet been invented.
What did our far-off ancestors do?</p>

<p>Let us pretend that we are going for a walk in the beautiful
garden of a country mansion. Here in the midst of a
rose bed stands a low stone pillar, with an upright, triangular
piece of metal attached to its top near the center, and some
figures marked in a circle around the edge.</p>

<div class="figright" >
   <a name="illus081.png" id="illus081.png"></a>
   <img src="images/illus081.png" alt="Sundial" title="Sundial" />
</div>

<p>This is a sun-dial. The owner
of the garden has it here for a
pretty ornament; but in the
old times, before the days of
clocks, people told the time by
means of sun-dials, judging the
hour by the position of the shadow
cast by the piece of metal upon
the stone. If you would like, just for the fun of it, to have
such a sun-clock in your own little garden, there is a very
easy way to make one.</p>

<p>Choose a spot of ground that is perfectly flat, where the
sun shines all day long. Set up, or get your father or big
brother to set up for you, a post four or five inches thick.
Make it stand perfectly firm and straight. Now find a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
thin, flat piece of board&mdash;a box top or a shingle will do&mdash;and
nail it like a table top on to the top of the post. After
these preparations have been made, you must wait for a
clear, starry night when you can go out and find the North
Star. The way to do this is by looking at the "Big Dipper",
the group of stars that of course you know.</p>

<div class="figleft" >
   <a name="illus082.png" id="illus082.png"></a>
   <img src="images/illus082.png" alt="Big Dipper" title="Big Dipper" />
</div>

<p>The two stars marked
A and B are called the
"Pointers"; and, looking
in the direction of
the arrow, the next star
in line with them is the
North Star. Take a
straight, thin stick, and
fasten it to the center
of the top of the post,
slanting it so that it will point directly at the North Star.
That is all you can do until the next day.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock, if the sun is bright, you will find your
slanting stick casting a shadow on the piece of board.
Mark the line where it falls, and put the figure 12 upon it,
to show that this line belongs to twelve o'clock. Do the
same thing at one, two, and three o'clock, and so on through
the afternoon. In the same way, the next day, you can
mark the morning hours.</p>

<p>If you like, you can print on your sun-dial the motto
that is often used for them: "Non horas sed serenas",
which means "I mark none but sunny hours".</p>

<h2><a name="AN_INDIAN_BUFFALO_HUNT" id="AN_INDIAN_BUFFALO_HUNT">AN INDIAN BUFFALO HUNT</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>This selection was written by a white man who ran away
from home when a boy and lived among the Indians of the
plains for twelve years about the middle of the last century.
He married an Indian maiden, Washtella, and became a chief
in the tribe. He gives many interesting descriptions of Indian
life and customs, which probably give some idea of the way
our own ancestors may have lived thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>The Indians depended upon the buffalo for their chief supply
of food. Millions of these animals roamed the plains in
vast herds. The Indians cannot be blamed in the least for
slaughtering these animals for food, but the white men who
drove the Indians from the plains killed the buffaloes often for
mere sport, and exterminated them except for a few small
herds now in captivity.</p>

<p>Read the story as rapidly as you can without skipping or
losing the meaning, and be prepared to stand in front of the
class and give a complete discussion of any of the topics given
at the end of the selection.</p></blockquote>

<p>When our camp was pitched, I walked out along the
banks of the beautiful lake, to see what I could discover.
Its waters were clear as crystal and full of fish. Not a
boat, and perhaps not even a canoe, had ever rippled its
bosom, and I could not but imagine, as I gazed across the
blue expanse, that one day commerce would spring up, and
towns and cities be built upon its green shores.</p>

<p>Looking to the north, I was startled from my reflections
by seeing a large buffalo cow coming down to the water to
drink. Hastening back to the village, I quickly procured
my Hawkins rifle and ran over the little eminence that hid
the lodges from the animal. She had approached quite
near the water, and was not more than one hundred and
fifty yards distant from me, when, hearing a noise in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
rear, I looked back and saw several Indians running toward
me with their guns. The cow at the same moment
saw them, and turned to make off; but too late, for I had
drawn a bead on her heart, and at one shot dropped her
dead.</p>

<p>All the village came running and shouting, and the
squaws gathered around the dead buffalo, jostling and elbowing
each other as they tore off the meat. It is the Indian
rule that game is common property, and my buffalo was
soon reduced to a pile of bones by the knives of the busy
squaws. I could not help laughing as I watched them
struggling for the choice morsels. First, the skin was carefully
removed, and then the muscles and gristle cut away.
Then, just as a squaw was about to take the coveted part,
she would be rudely thrust aside, and some other squaw
would take it. These exploits were received with loud
shouts of laughter, and no ill-temper or quarreling was
observed among the excited crowd of women who surrounded
the carcass.</p>

<p>On returning to my lodge, I found Washtella in great
glee over my good luck, and she explained that it was no
small matter to have killed the first buffalo slain in the
hunt. Presently I received a message from the chief, and
was informed by an old Indian that, having killed the first
buffalo, I would be entitled to lead the hunt on the first
day. Meat was brought me, and the skin or robe, which,
according to the Indian custom, is always given to the one
who kills the animal. So proud was Washtella that she
did nothing all the evening but talk of my good fortune,
and I could not help being amused at the boasts of the
little maid. Nothing could possibly have happened that
would have given her more pleasure.</p>

<p>The next morning, as soon as it was daylight, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
aroused, and told that the warriors were waiting for me
to lead them in the chase. Assembling all of them before
my lodge, I addressed them, saying I was a young man,
and lacked experience, but if they would allow me, I would
name one worthy to lead them in my place. This was received
with loud shouts of approval, and as soon as quiet
was restored, I pointed to a young warrior, and said: "He
is a good man, go and follow him." The warrior I had
selected was my bitter enemy. As his animosity was well
known in the tribe, the honors thus thrust upon him, by one
from whom he had expected no favors, surprised and
pleased them. For a moment the brave hung his head,
and then came forward, and, amid the shouts of the warriors,
gave me his hand. Feeling unwell, I did not go upon
the hunt that day, but in the evening, when the party
returned, my old enemy came to my lodge, and as a token
of his friendship, presented me with two fine robes he had
taken during the day.</p>

<p>On the second day I went out with the hunters, and
joined in a most exciting chase. Under the directions of a
chief, we deployed at wide distances, and then, closing in,
surrounded a herd of buffaloes on three sides; and as soon as
the herd began to move, the chase began. Our tough
little ponies bore us swiftly along, and soon the herd was
hard pressed. Presently it began to scatter, and then
each Indian, selected a buffalo and followed the beast up
until he had killed it. It is astonishing how fast the great
lumbering animals can run, and although they do not seem
to go over the ground very rapidly, it takes a good horse to
come up with them. Their shambling "lope" is equal in
speed to an American horse's gallop, and they can climb
steep hills and get over rough ground faster than a horse.
They run with their heads near the earth, and a hundred of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
them will make a mighty noise that resembles the rumbling
of distant thunder. The warriors do not stop to touch the
game after it is dead, as the skinning and packing of the
meat is the work of the squaws who follow in the wake of
the hunters. For this purpose they have pack-ponies, and
two women will skin and pack three or four buffaloes in a day.</p>

<p>The meat is brought to the village, is cut in narrow
slices, about an inch thick, and three or four inches long.
These slices are then hung on poles, or stretched on small
willows laid across a frame-work of poles. The meat is
frequently turned, and is allowed to remain in the sun and
air for three days. It should be covered or brought in at
night, and must not be allowed to get wet by rain while it is
curing. This is called jerking buffalo, and is a simple and
easy process of curing meat. The pure crisp air of the
plains soon dries it, and then it has a sweet, pleasant taste.
I have known climates on the plains where nearly all the
year carcasses could be hung up and left without spoiling
until used. Meat, when jerked, is only about half the
weight and size it is when in a raw state. If soaked in
water it will swell greatly, and then, unless used immediately,
it will spoil.</p>

<p>When the buffalo flesh is dried sufficiently, it is put into
parfleshes, or wrappers, made of rawhide cut square, which
will hold about half a bushel. They are sewed up at the
bottom and sides, the laps at the top being left open until
they are filled. The meat is then laid in flat and packed
tightly like plugs of tobacco. When two or three layers
of meat have been put in, hot buffalo fat is brought and
poured over it until all the interstices are filled up. Then
more layers of meat are put in and more fat poured on,
until the parflesh is full, when the laps are folded over each
other and tightly sewed up with sinews. The meat is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
ready for winter use, and two parfleshes are fastened together
like a pair of saddle-bags, and slung across the back
of a pony when the Indians travel. To prevent these bags
or wrappers from hurting the ponies' backs, the under side
is lined with fur or bear skin.</p>

<p>We had hunted four days from our camp on the lake, and
although we had taken the utmost precaution not unnecessarily
to alarm the buffaloes most of them had gone a long
distance from the village. A council was called, and it was
determined we should go over to the lakes that lay on the
Jim River, sixty miles distant. We immediately set out,
moving around the lake to the right of the buffaloes, so as
not to disturb them. Our route lay across a beautiful level
country through which meandered little streams eight or
ten miles apart. We traveled leisurely along, however,
halting on the creeks, and making about sixteen miles per
day, for many of our ponies were already heavily laden with
meat.</p>

<p>On the fourth day we reached the lakes, and again pitched
our village. Here we found plenty of buffaloes and a great
many calves, which were very acceptable to us, as we
wanted some parfleshes of veal.</p>

<p>We hunted four days, and took a great deal of meat.
Each family had from three to six parfleshes, according to
its size, which was as much as it could use during the
winter, and enough for the infirm besides. So the hunt
was announced at an end, and we began to prepare for our
return. I had been exceedingly fortunate, and had taken
no less than nine parfleshes of meat and had twelve robes.</p>

<p>There are several methods of killing buffaloes besides the
regular chase. One of these, as practiced by the Indians,
is as follows:</p>

<p>The buffaloes are watched until they graze near a precipice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
when two or three Indians put a buffalo skin on sticks, and
concealing themselves under it, approach near the herd
slowly, as if grazing. This must be done when the wind is
favorable, and blowing from the buffaloes. If the decoy is
successful, other Indians make a wide circuit, surrounding
the herd on all sides, except that toward the bluff. Then
they steal up as close as possible, and when the buffaloes,
discover them, they shout, shake their blankets and poles,
and close in upon the herd. The animals are greatly alarmed,
but seeing the mock buffalo (which has managed to attract
attention) set off for the bluffs, they rush madly after it.
When the baiters reach the bluff, they fling the mock
buffalo over the precipice, and betake themselves to holes
in the bank or crevices among the rocks. It is in vain the
leaders of the herd halt when they see the chasm; the mass
from behind, crazed by the poles and blankets of the
Indians, who are now close upon them, rush madly on, and
press those in front over the cliff.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly dangerous to bait buffalo, as the herd
frequently overtake the false buffalo and trample it beneath
their feet, or the great beasts, falling among the
rock, crush the Indian baiters to death. Many reckless
young Indians, who as baiters have gone too far inland,
have, after the chase, been found dead on the plain, or their
mangled bodies lay at the foot of the precipice with the
carcasses of the animals they had so cruelly deceived. It
takes a brave Indian to be a baiter, but there are always
plenty of young and foolish boys who are anxious to engage
in the dangerous sport.</p>

<p>After the buffaloes have fallen and killed or maimed themselves,
a party of Indians who have been concealed near
the foot of the precipice suddenly advance and finish them
with axes and rifles.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Our hunt having ended, the chief ordered that the usual
feast and rejoicing should take place. A long pole was
provided, a buffalo head put on the top of it, and a number
of tails nailed, at right angles, to the sides. The pole was
then set firmly in the ground, in the center of an open space
before the village, and buffalo heads were piled up around
it. The heads were set in a circle, and arranged to look as
hideous as possible.</p>

<p>Immense quantities of buffalo meat were now brought,
and the feast was made ready. At these feasts nothing but
buffalo meat is eaten, and every one makes it a point to
gorge himself to the fullest extent. Even the dogs are
stuffed, and the women and children are persuaded to eat
while they can force down a bite. The greater the quantity
of meat eaten, the greater the honor; and some starve
themselves for two or three days in advance, in order to do
justice to the occasion. The meat is prepared in every
form&mdash;boiled, fried, broiled, roasted, and raw.</p>

<p>When one can eat no more, he goes to the pole, and as
soon as a sufficient number have collected, the dance begins.
The warriors sit in a circle around the pole, and the squaws,
gaudily dressed and painted, form a circle around the
warriors. At a signal the drums beat, and all stand up.
Then the squaws sing, and the warriors move around to
the right and the squaws to the left, each keeping time to
the drums. The dance is a slow, shuffling motion that
soon makes one very tired. When one of the Indians gets
tired, he steps out of the circle and another takes his place.
As soon as it is dark, wood is brought, fires are made around
the pole, and the dancing is kept up all night. The feasting
frequently continues for three days, and at no time is the
pole without its set of dancers. The amount of buffalo
consumed is prodigious, when we consider that, besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
vast quantities eaten by the Indians, each family has from
six to ten days.</p>

<p>When the feast was over, we began to prepare in earnest
for our return. The meat was carefully distributed, so that
no pony would be overloaded, and everything was neatly
packed. It took both my ponies and all my dogs to carry
my meat and lodge, so Washtella and I had to walk. We
considered this no great hardship, however, as nearly the
whole village was on foot. We made only eight or ten
miles a day; but at last, after a most fatiguing march,
reached the Missouri, and entered our old camp near Fort
Randall.</p>

<h2><a name="INDIAN_LIFE_AND_CUSTOMS" id="INDIAN_LIFE_AND_CUSTOMS">INDIAN LIFE AND CUSTOMS</a></h2>


<p>This selection tells of life among the Indians of our western
plains before the buffalo became almost extinct.</p>

<p>As you read, write topics that will enable you to recall the
various things the author tells about. Your teacher will have
two or three of you put your list of topics on the blackboard
and will ask various members of the class to come to the front
of the room and tell the class about one topic each. While a
pupil is reciting no one should raise his hand nor interrupt.
Be a good sport and give the one who is reciting a chance to
make his topic as interesting as he can.</p>

<p>This selection can be divided into several large topics with
details under each. These details may be stated as sub-topics
under the large ones. Your teacher may wish you to look it
over again to see if you can find the four main topics.</p>

<p>Nothing is more important in learning to remember what
you read than the habit of organizing your material in the
form of an outline. A good outline generally takes some such
form as this:</p>

<p>
Introduction<br />
<br />
1. First main topic<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>b</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>c</i>)</span><br />
</p>

<p>Sometimes there may be two, and sometimes several sub-topics.
Never use any letter if there is only one topic. When
there is only one topic under any heading, you should simply
write the topic out.</p>

<p>
2. Second main topic<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>b</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>c</i>), etc.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Use as many main topics as you need to tell the story or to include
the substance of what you are outlining.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>One can have no appreciative idea of an Indian village,
unless he has been permitted to come across the prairie
through a hot summer's sun, and suddenly discovers one
nestled under the broad shade trees, beside a clear running
stream, in a green valley. How pleasant the grass then
looks; how refreshing the bright waters, and how cozy the
tall lodges, with their shaded verandas of thickly interwoven
boughs!</p>

<p>All day long we had toiled over the scorching plain,
through clouds of grasshoppers that often struck us in the
face with sufficient force to make the skin smart for several
minutes. Once we had seen a mirage of a beautiful lake,
fringed with trees and surrounded by green pastures which
invited us to pursue its fleeting shadows, but we knew all
about these deceptions by sad experience, and pushed
steadily on over the burning sands.</p>

<p>These mirages often deceive the weary traveler of the
desert. Suddenly the horseman sees a river or lake, apparently
just ahead of him, and he rides on and on, hoping
to come up to it. For hours it lies before his eyes, and then
in a moment disappears, leaving him miles and miles out
of his way in the midst of desert sands. Men have ridden
all day striving to reach the beautiful river just before
them, and then at night have turned back to plod their
weary way to where they had started from in the morning.</p>

<p>The mirage we had seen was most delightful, representing
a clear lake, with trees, meadows, and villages nestling on its
shores, but it scarcely equalled the reality of the scene
when, late in the afternoon, we ascended a rise in the
prairie, and saw below us a wide stream lined with green
trees, and on its banks a large Indian encampment.</p>

<p>The ponies pricked up their ears and neighed with pleasure
as they smelt the water, and our own delight was unbounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
We halted for a moment to admire the beautiful prospect.
Through the majestic trees slanting rays of the sun shivered
on the grass! Far away, winding like a huge silver-serpent,
ran the river, while near by in a shady grove stood the
village with the children at play on the green lawns not
made by hands. The white sides of the teepees shone in
the setting sunlight, and the smoke curled lazily upward
from their dingy tops. Bright ribbons and red grass, looking
like streamers on a ship, fluttered from the lodge-poles,
and gaudily dressed squaws and warriors walked about, or
sat on the green sod under the trees.</p>

<p>Near the village were hundreds of horses and ponies, with
bright feathers flaunting in their manes and tails as they
cropped the rich grass of the valley.</p>

<p>A group of noisy children were playing at a game much
resembling ten-pins; some boys were shooting at a mark
with arrows, and up the stream several youths were returning
home with rod and line, and fine strings of speckled
trout.</p>

<p>Scores of men and women were swimming about in the
river, now diving, and then dousing each other amid screams
of laughter from the bystanders on the shore. Here and
there a young girl darted about like a fish, her black hair
streaming behind her in the water.</p>

<p>While we looked, the little children suddenly ceased from
play and ran into the lodges; mounted men surrounded
the herd of horses, and the swimmers and promenaders
hastened toward the village. We had been perceived by
the villagers, and the unexpected arrival of strange horsemen
at an Indian encampment always creates great excitement.
They may be friends, but they are more often
enemies, so the villagers are always prepared for a surprise.</p>

<p>Soon men were seen running to and fro with guns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
bows, and in a few minutes, some mounted warriors left the
encampment and rode toward us, going first to the top of
the highest mounds to see if they could discover other
horsemen in the rear or to the right or left of us.</p>

<p>No sooner did they ascertain there were but three in the
party, than they rode boldly up and asked us our business.
I told them who we were, and where we were from, upon
which they cordially invited us to the village.</p>

<p>As we approached, men, women, and children poured out
of the encampment to look at the strangers, and having
satisfied their curiosity, the sports and amusements of the
evening were renewed.</p>

<p>I asked permission to camp of no one, for I needed none.
So I marched right down to the center of the village, and
finding a vacant space, pitched my lodge.</p>

<p>A few Santee women gathered about my squaws and
chatted with them, anxious to learn the news from down the
river. Seeing they were interfering with the unpacking of
the ponies and the erecting of the lodge, I unceremoniously
ordered them to be gone, and they went quietly away. The
lodge was soon up and the ponies unpacked and put out to
graze. Having seen things put in order for the night, I
sauntered out through the village to learn the news.</p>

<p>I was agreeably surprised when I learned there was a
white man in the village, who had been sent out to the
Indians as a missionary. All the savages spoke of him as
a kind-hearted, good man, who was a great friend of the
Great Spirit, and of the Big Father at Washington.</p>

<p>I made haste to pay my respects to my white brother
and found him indeed a good Christian gentleman. He
had a white wife and child, and he and they were living
comfortably and pleasantly with these wild children of the
desert. I talked more than an hour with the good man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
it was so delightful to see and speak with one of my own
blood and color. When I left him, I promised I would
return the next day and dine with him. It may sound
strange to hear one talk of "dining out" in an Indian
camp, but the meal was none the less wholesome or abundant
on account of the place in which it was served.</p>

<p>I found the Santees a most excellent people. The warriors
were men of great pride and bravery. The chiefs of the
Santees were men of few words, but they were dignified,
courteous, and truthful in all they said and did. After all
my experiences and disappointments among the Indians of
the plains, I could not help admiring and respecting these
people, for here at last I had found a tribe such as Cooper
had represented, and Longfellow had characterized in
"Hiawatha".</p>

<p>The Santee lodges were tall conical-shaped tents, made of
buffalo hide tanned with the hair off, and stretched around
twelve poles. These poles are tied together at the top, and
set around a circle of one hundred and eight feet. The
lodge, when finished, is thirty-six feet in diameter at the
ground. The skin or covering is cut bias, the small end
being fastened to the top of the poles and the long end
wrapped round and round the poles, and finally fastened
to the ground with a wooden pin or stone. The poles are
not set in the ground, but the edge of the lodge-cover is
pinned down with short pegs made of hard wood. An
aperture is left at the top of the lodge for the smoke to
escape, and the fire is built in the center. When the door
is open it draws well, and all the smoke goes up and out
at the aperture.</p>

<p>These lodges, although standing on the surface of the
ground and apparently very fragile, will withstand the
most violent wind and rain storms. I have seen them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
outlive the strongest modern tents, and stand up even when
great trees were blown down.</p>

<p>During my residence in the Santee village I saw many
curious things, and learned much of the mode of life and
ceremonies of the Indians.</p>

<p>Most people have seen the bows and arrows used by boys
in the eastern States, and those who have observed them
know how feeble they are, not even being capable of killing
the smallest animal. Do not be surprised, then, when I
tell you that an Indian with his bow, will send an arrow
entirely through a horse, a man, or a buffalo. The shaggy-coated
bear or Rocky Mountain lion will fall beneath a few
shots from the savage's strong bow, while the fleet wild
deer is not swift enough to escape the flight of his arrow.
With unerring aim the hunter sends his deadly shaft, at
eighty yards, into the heart or eye of his game, and with
ease tips birds from the tops of the highest trees. Of
course, it requires long practice to acquire such skill in the
use of the bow, but the Indian will tell you that more depends
upon the manufacture of the weapon than the skill
of the marksman. With a good Indian bow and arrow a
white man can, in a few hours, learn to shoot fairly well,
while with a bow and arrow of his own manufacture he can
hardly hit a tree the size of a man's body a rod off.</p>

<p>Let me teach you how to make a good bow and arrow.
And first we will begin with the arrow. The shoots, or
rods, must be cut in the arrow season; that is, when the
summer's growth is ended. They must not have any
branches or limbs on them, but must be straight and
smooth. The Indians cut their arrows late in the fall, when
the timber is hardening to withstand the blasts of winter.
The sticks are not quite as thick as one's little finger, and
they are sorted and tied in bundles of twenty and twenty-five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
These bundles are two and two and one-half feet in
length, and are wrapped tightly from end to end with
strips of rawhide or elk skin. The sticks are then hung up
over fire in the teepee to be smoked and dried, and the
wrapping keeps them from warping or bending. When
they are seasoned, which takes several weeks, the bundles
are taken down, the covering removed, and the bark scraped
off. The wood is very tough then, and of a yellowish color.
The next process is to cut the arrow shafts exactly one length,
and in this great care must be used; for arrows of different
lengths fly differently, and, unless they are alike, the hunter's
aim is destroyed. Another reason for measuring the length
of arrows is to identify them; for no two warriors shoot
arrows of precisely the same length. Each warrior carries
a measuring, or pattern stick, and it is necessary only to
compare an arrow with the stick to find out to whom it
belongs. But should the arrows by chance be of one length,
there are other means of identifying them; for every hunter
has his own private mark in the shaft, the head, or the
feather. Of many thousands I have examined, I have
never found two arrows exactly alike when they were made
by different warriors.</p>

<p>When the shafts have been made even, the next work is
to form the notch for the bow-string. This is done with a
sharp knife, and, when made properly, the bottom of the
notch will be precisely in the center of the shaft. The arrow
is then scraped and tapered toward the notch, leaving a
round head an inch long near the notch to prevent the
string from splitting the shaft, and to make a firm hold for
the thumb and forefinger in drawing the bow.</p>

<p>All the arrows are peeled, scraped, and notched, and
then the warrior creases them. To do this, he takes an
arrow-head and scores the shaft in zigzag lines from end to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
end. These creases, or fluted gutters, in the shaft are to
let the blood run out when an animal is struck. The
blood flows along the little gutters in the wood and runs
off the end of the arrow. The arrow-head is made of steel
or stone. It is shaped like a heart or dart and has a stem
about an inch long. The sides of the stem are nicked or
filed out like saw-teeth. Nearly all the wild Indians now
use steel arrow-heads, which are a great article of trade
among the savages. Certain firms in the East manufacture
many hundreds of thousands every year and send them
to the traders who sell them to the Indians for furs.</p>

<p>When the shaft is ready for the head, the warrior saws a
slit with a nicked knife in the end opposite the notch, and
inserts the stem of the arrow-head. The slit must be
exactly in the center of the shaft, and as deep as the stem
is long. When properly adjusted, the teeth of the stem
show themselves on each side of the slit. Buffalo, deer, or
elk sinew is then softened in water, and the wood is wrapped
firmly to the arrowhead, taking care to fit the sinew in the
teeth of the stem to prevent the head from pulling out.</p>

<p>The next process is to put on the feathers. To do this
properly great care must be taken. Turkey or eagle quills
are soaked in warm water to make them split easily and
uniformly. The feather is then stripped from the quill
and put on the shaft of the arrow. Three feathers are
placed on each shaft, and they are laid equi-distant along
the stem. The big end of the feather is fastened near the
notch of the shaft and laid six or eight inches straight along
the wood. The feathers are glued to the shaft and wrapped
at each end with fine sinew. The arrow is next painted,
marked, dried, and is ready for use. It takes a warrior a
whole day to make an arrow, for which the trader allows
him ten cents.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrow-heads are put up in packages of a dozen each. They
cost the trader half a cent, or six cents per package, and are
sold to the Indians at enormous profits. Thus, twelve
arrow-heads will be exchanged for a buffalo robe, worth
$8 or $9, and three, for a beaver skin, worth $4. Indians
often buy arrow-heads at these enormous prices, and then
sell the arrow back to the trader at ten cents, in exchange
for goods, beads, or knives.</p>

<p>Travelers on the prairie have often seen the Indians throwing
up signal lights at night, and have wondered how it was
done. I will tell you all about it. They take off the head
of the arrow and dip the shaft in gunpowder, mixed with
glue. This they call making fire-arrows. The gunpowder
adheres to the wood, and coats it three or four inches from
its end, to the depth of one-fourth of an inch. Chewed
bark mixed with dry gunpowder is then fastened to the
stick, and the arrow is ready for use. When it is to be
fired, a warrior places it on his bow-string and draws his
bow ready to let it fly; the point of the arrow is then lowered;
another warrior lights the dry bark, and it is shot high in the
air. When it has gone up a little distance, it bursts out into
flame, and burns brightly until it falls to the ground. Various
meanings are attached to these fire-arrow signals. Thus,
one arrow meant, among the Santees, "The enemy are
about"; two arrows from the same point, "Danger";
three, "Great danger"; many, "They are too strong, or
we are falling back"; two arrows sent up at the same
moment, "We will attack"; three, "Soon"; four, "Now";
if shot diagonally, "In that direction." These signals are
constantly changed, and are always agreed upon when the
party goes out or before it separates. The Indians send
their signals very intelligently, and seldom make mistakes
in telegraphing each other by these silent monitors. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
amount of information they can communicate, by fires and
burning arrows, is perfectly wonderful. Every war party
carries with it bundles of signal arrows.</p>

<p>The bow&mdash;the weapon so long in use among the different
Indian tribes of this continent and so typical of Indian life&mdash;is
made of various kinds of wood, and its manufacture is a
work of no little labor. Even at this day the bow is much
used, and although an Indian may have a gun, he is seldom
seen without his long bow, and his quiver well filled with
arrows. The gun may get out of order, and he can not
mend it; the ammunition may become wet, and there is
an end of hunting; but the faithful bow is always in order,
and its swift arrows ready to fly in wet as well as dry weather.
Thus reasons the savage, and so he keeps his bow to fall
back upon in case of accident.</p>

<p>Until the invention of breech-loaders, the bow was a far
more deadly weapon at close range than the best rifle.
A warrior could discharge his arrows with much greater
rapidity and precision than the most expert woodsman
could charge and fire a muzzle-loading rifle.</p>

<p>The Indian boy's first lesson in life is to shoot with a
bow. He is furnished with a small bow and "beewaks",
or blunt arrows, so that he will hurt nobody, and with these
he shoots at marks. By and by, when he has acquired some
skill in handling his weapon, he is given small arrow-points,
and with these he shoots birds, squirrels, and small beasts.
As he grows older he receives the long-bow, and at last the
strong-bow.</p>

<p>These strong-bows are powerful weapons, and I have
seen them so stiff that a white man could not bend them
more than four inches, while an Indian would, with apparent
ease, draw them to the arrow's head. A shaft fired from
one of these bows will go through the body of a buffalo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and arrow-heads have been found so firmly imbedded in the
thigh bones of a man that no force could extract them.</p>

<p>The parents take great pride in teaching young Indians
to shoot, and the development of the muscles and strength
of their arms is watched with much interest. A stout arm,
ornamented with knots of muscles is a great honor to an
Indian, and no one but those who can handle the strong-bow
are deemed fit for war.</p>

<p>Of all the Indians of the West, the Sioux and Crows make
the best bows. The Sioux bow is generally four feet long,
one and a half inches wide, and an inch thick at the middle.
It tapers from the center, or "grasp", toward the ends, and
is but half an inch wide and half an inch thick at the extremities.
At one end the bow-string is notched into the
wood and made permanently fast, while at the other end
two notches are cut in the wood, and the string at that end
of the bow is made like a slip-knot or loop. When the bow
is to be used, the warrior sets the end to which the string
is made fast firmly on the ground, and then bends down the
other end until the loop slips into the notch. This is called
"stringing" the bow. The bow is never kept strung except
when in actual use, as it would lose its strength and
elasticity by being constantly bent. When unstrung, a
good bow is perfectly straight, and, if properly made and
seasoned, will always retain its elasticity.</p>

<p>The wood generally used in manufacturing bows is ash,
hickory, iron-wood, elm, and cedar. No hickory grows
west of the Missouri, and it is very difficult to get; and
an Indian will always pay a high price for a piece of this
wood.</p>

<p>When the bow is made of cedar, it need not be seasoned;
but all other woods require seasoning, and are not worked
until perfectly dry. Every teepee has its bow-wood hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
up with the arrows in the smoke of the fire well out of reach
of the flames. A warrior with a sharp knife and a sandstone,
or file, can make a bow in three days if he works hard,
but it generally takes a week, and sometimes a month, to
finish a fancy bow. When done, it is worth three dollars in
trade.</p>

<p>All the bows differ in length and strength, being gauged
for the arms of those who are to use them; but a white
man would, until he learned the trick of it, find himself
unable to bend even the weakest war-bow. This has given
rise to the impression that the Indians are stronger than
white men, which is an error; for, although only a slight man
myself, I learned, after some practice, to bend the strongest
bow, and could send a shaft as far or as deep as any savage.
On one occasion I shot an arrow, while running, into a
buffalo so that the point came out on the opposite side;
another arrow disappeared in the buffalo, not even the
notch being visible. I have seen a bow throw an arrow five
hundred yards, and have myself often discharged one entirely
through a board one inch thick. Once I found a
man's skull transfixed to a tree by an arrow which had
gone completely through the bones, and imbedded itself so
deep in the wood as to sustain the weight of the head. He
had probably been tied up to the tree and shot.</p>

<p>The surface of the bow is made perfectly flat, then roughened
with a file or stone, the sinew being dipped in hot
glue and laid on the wood. The sinew is then lapped at the
ends and on the middle or grasp of the bow. The string is
attached while green, twisted, and left to dry on the bow.
The whole outside of the wood and sinew is now covered
with a thick solution of glue, and the bow is done. Rough
bows look like hickory limbs with the bark on, but some of
them are beautifully painted and ornamented. I once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
knew a trader to glue some red velvet on a bow, and the
Indians paid him an immense price for it, thinking it very
wonderful.</p>

<p>In traveling, the bow is carried in a sheath attached to
the arrow quiver, and the whole is slung to the back by a
belt of elk or buckskin, which passes diagonally across the
breast, and is fastened to the ends of the quiver. The
quiver and bow-sheath is generally made of the skin of an
ox or some wild animal, and is tanned with the hair on.
The quiver is ornamented with tassels or fringe of buckskin,
and the belt across the breast is painted or worked with
beads. Each Indian has his sign or name on his belt,
bow, sheath, or arrow quiver. The celebrated Sioux chief,
Spotted Tail, or "Sin-ta Gallessca", had his bow-sheath
made from the skin of a spotted ox he had killed in a train
his warriors captured, and as the tail was left dangling at
the end of the sheath, the Indians ever afterward called him
Spotted Tail, or "The man with the Spotted Tail". You
may be curious to know what this Indian's name was before
he was called Spotted Tail, and I must tell you many Indians
never have a name, while others have half a dozen.
Some act of bravery, or an article of clothing, generally
fixes an Indian's name, but a new deed, or a new head-dress,
may change it.</p>

<p>To shoot with the bow properly, it must be held firmly
in three fingers of the right hand; the arrow is fixed on the
bow-string with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand,
and the other three fingers are used to pull the string. The
shaft of the arrow lays between the thumb and forefinger
of the right hand, which rest over the grasp of the bow.
To shoot, the bow is turned slightly, so that one end is
higher than the other, and the arrow is then launched.</p>

<h2><a name="OPENING_THE_GREAT_WEST" id="OPENING_THE_GREAT_WEST">OPENING THE GREAT WEST</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is a picture of the work of the army of the United
States in opening the great prairie country of the West. Today
we get immense quantities of our food from the states between
the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Seventy years
ago the most of this territory, now the richest farming country
in the United States, was inhabited chiefly by roving tribes
of Indians who lived mainly by hunting the buffalo.</p>

<p>You will notice many details that show that the story was
written many years ago. For instance, the soldiers are spoken
of as "blue jackets". Make a list of these points as you read.</p>

<p>Read the selection as rapidly as you can without overlooking
important details. When the majority of the class has finished,
your teacher will ask you in turn to stand before the class and
recite on the topics given at the end. You should try to make
your recitation interesting by giving details that will help your
hearers to see what the author has described.</p></blockquote>

<p>As soon as the traveler crosses the Missouri, and enters
the territories, he begins to find the blue jackets, and the
farther west he goes the more numerous they become. It
is only just to the army to say that it has ever been the
pioneer of civilization in America. Ever since Washington
crossed the Alleghanies, and, with his brave Virginians,
pushed to the Ohio, the work has been steadily going on.
From Pittsburgh, the army led far down the Ohio to the
Mississippi, and thence along the Father of Waters to New
Orleans; next west to the Miami, and far up the lakes;
then to the Missouri, and so on for thousands of miles until
the other ocean was reached through Oregon and California.
A line of forts is pushed out into the new and uninhabited
country, and presently people come in and settle near the
posts. A few years elapse, and there are hundreds of
citizens in all directions. Then the forts are sold or pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
down, and the troops march farther west to new posts.</p>

<p>The knapsacks are packed, the cavalry are mounted, and
we are ready to occupy a new line of country. "Head of
column west, forward, march!" and away we go. What an
outfit! The long lines of cavalry wind over the hills, and
then follows the compact column of infantry. Then come
a few pieces of artillery and the train. What a sight!
Hundreds of wagons, filled with every conceivable article
of food and implement of labor: steam-engines, saw-mills,
picks, shovels, hoes, masses of iron, piles of lumber, tons of
pork, hard bread, flour, rice, sugar, coffee, tea, and potatoes,
all drawn in huge wagons. Six mules or ten oxen are seen
tugging the monster wheeled machines along. The train is
generally preceded by a score or two of carriages, ambulances,
and light wagons, containing the families of officers,
women, children, and laundresses. Behind the wagon train
are driven the herds of cattle and sheep, and, last of all,
comes a company of infantry, and, perhaps, one of cavalry.</p>

<p>Day after day the living, moving mass toils on toward
the setting sun. Bridges are built, gulleys filled, hill-sides
dug down, and roads cut along precipices. We wonder how
the pioneer corps can keep out of our way; but each day we
go steadily forward, seeing only their work, never overtaking
them. A ride to the front will show us how this is
done. It is mid-day, and a company is going out to relieve
the pioneers. The knapsacks are lightened, and off we go
at a quick pace. At sundown we come upon the pioneers,
and find some building a bridge, while others cut down the
hill so the wagons can pass. We relieve them of their
shovels, picks, and axes, and one-half of the company goes
into camp, and the other half goes to work. At midnight
we are aroused by the beating of the drum, and the half of
the company that is in camp goes out to relieve the working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
party. At daylight we are relieved in turn; the work goes
on day and night, and that is the way the pioneers keep
ahead of the train.</p>

<p>Let us return to the column. It is near sunset, the
bugles sound the halt, and the columns file off into camp.
The cavalry horses are sent out to graze, the tents put up,
fires lighted and the suppers put on to cook. The white
canvas gleams in the setting sun, and the camp resounds
with mirth and laughter. Water is brought from the brook,
and soap and towels are in great demand to remove the dust
and stains of travel. Folding chairs, tables, beds, mattresses,
are opened out, and carpets spread on the ground.
The butchers have slaughtered a beef or two, and the fresh
meat is brought in for distribution. The commissary
wagons are opened, and sugar, coffee, rice, hominy, and
canned fruits dealt out. In an hour we sit down to a
smoking hot dinner and supper of roast beef, hot coffee,
fried potatoes, fresh biscuit, and canned peaches. If the
air is cool the little peaked Sibley stoves are put up, and the
evening is spent in telling stories, playing cards, and singing
songs. Here is heard the thrumming of a guitar; there
are a lot of officers playing euchre, and yonder a group of
soldiers gathered about their camp-fire telling tales of how
they campaigned in Oregon, or fought the Comanches and
Apaches in Texas and New Mexico twenty years ago.</p>

<p>The bugles sound tattoo, the rolls are called, taps blow,
the lights are put out, and the busy camp sinks into stillness.
Only here and there a light is left burning, where the
quartermaster in his tent is busy over his papers, the adjutant
making the orders for the morrow's march, or a
noisy trio of officers continuing to a late hour their jests
and songs. No soldier is allowed to have his light burning
after taps, but the officers can do as they please.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one sleeps soundly, for each knows he is well
guarded. It is near midnight, and, if you like, we will
walk about the camp a little. Here is the officer of the
day, and we will accompany him. We go out to the edge
of the camp, where a large group of men are gathered about
a blazing fire. "Who comes there?" rings out upon the
still night air. "Friends," is answered back. "Advance
one and be recognized." This is done, and then comes the
cry of "Officer of day, turn out the guard". There is a
rattling of muskets, a hurrying and bustling to and fro, and
the guard falls into line and is inspected&mdash;so far as to ascertain
that all are present and every thing right. Frequently
an officer, but most generally a sergeant of experience,
commands the guard, and all the sentinels are posted
according to the directions of the officer of the day, who
receives his instructions from the commanding officer.</p>

<p>The wagons are drawn up in long lines or semicircles,
with the tongues inward, to which are tied the mules and
oxen. Sentinels pace up and down to see that all goes
right, and rouse the teamsters to tie up the mules that are
constantly getting loose. The cry of "loose mules" will
bring a dozen teamsters out of their wagons, and at least
a hundred oaths before the animal is caught and secured.
The cavalry wagons are placed twenty to thirty feet apart,
and long ropes drawn through the hind wheels, to which
are picketed the horses. Guards are everywhere, and the
sentinels are keenly on the alert. Each hill-top has its
silent watcher. The herds are kept where there is as much
grass as possible, and mounted herders constantly watch
them, ready for an Indian alarm or a stampede. A cry of
"Indians, Indians," produces great life and commotion
among the herders, guards, and sentinels, but the body of
the camp does not deign to move unless the firing is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
heavy, and the order given to "turn out". This is the
Regular Army on the march.</p>

<p>When the troops enter the Indian country, and the
attacks become frequent, the column marches more compactly;
the herds and wagons are kept well up; the women
and children are put among the infantry; flankers thrown
out, and a howitzer sent to the front to throw shells and
frighten off the savages. The boom of a cannon seems to
be the voice of advancing civilization, and greatly terrifies
the Indians.</p>

<p>At last the line of country that is to be occupied has been
reached, and a fort is built. This consists of a stockade,
log-houses, and shelters for the stores. Then the troops
are divided, and another fort is built fifty or a hundred
miles from the first, and so on until the whole line is "occupied".
If there is danger, earthworks are thrown up,
and one or two pieces mounted. Now begins the work in
earnest; keeping open the communication between the
forts; getting up supplies from the rear, and securing the
way for immigration. The country is mapped, the land
surveyed, the streams looked up and named, and saw-mills
built. Settlers come in and open farms near the forts, and
they creep up and down the valleys, and over the hills, until
they stretch away for hundreds of miles. Meanwhile, there
are Indian battles, surprises, and massacres by scores.
Hundreds lose their lives, but the settlements go on. There
is a little grocery, a rum shop, a town, and by and by a city.</p>

<p>Every spring, as soon as the grass grows, the cavalry
takes the field and scours over the country for hundreds of
miles. The infantry remains in the posts, or guards trains
to and fro. From April until December, the cavalry is on
the go constantly, and the officers are separated from their
families. When the snows fall they come into the forts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
winter, but are often routed out by the approach of their
savage foes, and made to march hundreds of miles when the
thermometer is far below zero. It is this that makes the
troops so savage, and often causes them to slaughter the
Indians without mercy. After a long and hard summer's
campaign, the officers and men come in tired, weary, and
only too glad to rejoin their families and rest, when scarcely
have they removed the saddles from their horses' backs,
when murders, robberies, and burnings announce the approach
of the fierce foe, and they are ordered out for a
winter campaign. Full of rage and chagrin, they go forth
breathing vengeance on all Indians, and after toiling a
month or more, through ice and snow, with freezing hands,
feet, and ears, they overtake the savages and punish them
with terrible severity.</p>

<p>In this way our great western plains are opened to
civilization. Every year millions of acres are added to
our national domain. The wild prairie with its countless
buffaloes and its skulking, murderous war-parties of red men
becomes the frontier; the frontier becomes the settled
farms and villages; the iron horse and the telegraph connect
it with the great East; and still the pioneer and the
army push ahead to open up still more of the richest
land in the world to the conquering axe and plow of the
Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TRAINING_OF_A_BOY_KING" id="THE_TRAINING_OF_A_BOY_KING">THE TRAINING OF A BOY KING</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>We think little of kings and princes nowadays. They appear
chiefly in our fairy stories when we know they are pure
creations of somebody's imagination. Possibly some of you
have wished you had been born a prince or princess. This
story will give you a glimpse of the real life of a prince who
was the son of one of the most powerful kings of England.</p>

<p>Almost everybody knows something about Queen Elizabeth,
the famous queen who made England such a powerful country
long ago in the sixteenth century. And almost everybody
knows something about her older sister, Queen Mary, who
caused so much sorrow to England because of religious persecution.
But not nearly so many people know about their
younger brother, King Edward the Sixth, who came to the
throne before either of his sisters, and whose short life was
full of burdens and anxieties. This story tells something about
the way in which a boy had to be educated if he was going to
be a king. You will see that he had very little chance for
freedom or happiness.</p>

<p>Read the story through quickly, and then glance back and
make an outline of it. Your teacher will let two or three of
you tell the story from the outline you have made.</p></blockquote>

<p>Almost four hundred years ago all London was rejoicing
because of the birth of a prince, the son of the wicked
Henry the Eighth. To be sure, Henry had two other
children, Mary and Elizabeth; but there were reasons, it
was thought, why neither of them could inherit the throne.
So the people were glad when little Edward was born;
anthems of joy were sung in all the churches; bonfires
were lit, and bells rang.</p>

<p>Three days later, when the baby prince was baptized,
the way from the palace to the chapel was hung with silk
and velvet and cloth of gold, and lined with torch-bearers.
Noble lords held a shining canopy over his head, and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
carried the towels and basins needed in the ceremony. His
sister Mary, a gracious lady of twenty-one, was his godmother,
the archbishop was his godfather, and little red-haired
Elizabeth, only four years old, also had a share in
the ceremony.</p>

<p>Ten days later joy was turned to mourning, for the
Queen died, and little Prince Edward was left motherless.
The baby, however, had a kind nurse and many servants,
four of whom were called "rockers", as it was then thought
right to rock a baby in his cradle or in the arms. All these
servants were charged to watch and guard the Prince night
and day lest any harm should befall him, for, as King Henry
said, he was "the whole realm's most precious jewel".</p>

<p>While Edward was a little child he lived chiefly in the
country, and was brought up till he was six years old by
the women of the household. After that he had learned
men for his schoolmasters, and they taught him languages,
philosophy, and such art and science as were known at the
time. Such studies sound like very grown-up lessons for a
little boy, do they not? A large part of education in those
days consisted of Greek and Latin. Both Edward and his
sister Elizabeth were very fond of books, and many were the
happy mornings that the two children spent together over
their lessons.</p>

<p>Besides his sister, Edward had other school companions.
In order that he might not be alone, several boys, the sons
of noblemen, were brought up in the palace along with the
Prince. One of them, it is said, was known as Edward's
"whipping boy"; that is, if the Prince misbehaved, as he
seldom did, this boy was punished for it, as it was not
thought proper to punish the Prince himself.</p>

<p>By the time he was eight, the boy could both read and
write Latin. He wrote his letters in Latin, and several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
them, along with three of his exercise books, have been
handed down to the present time. The books are filled
with Greek and Latin exercises. He must have been a
clever boy, and must also have studied hard and long.</p>

<p>One winter morning when Edward was nine years old,
gentlemen came riding out from London with the news
that his father, King Henry, was dead, and that Edward
was the new King. He wept bitterly, for to him his father
had always been loving and gentle, however cruel he was
to others. But the boy could not weep long, for he had to
mount his horse and ride to London to be welcomed by the
people. The next day all the nobles came and knelt before
him to kiss his hand and swear that they would always be
loyal. But Edward was still too young to be really king.
His father had left the government in the hands of eighteen
men whom he named. These men now decided that they
would put all the power into the hands of the most important
one among them, Edward's uncle, the Duke of Somerset,
who should be called Lord Protector.</p>

<p>For a long time hardly a day passed without some tiresome
state ceremony to which the little King had to go.
You can imagine that he grew very tired of so much showing
off. At last came the coronation. The day before it,
King Edward rode through the streets in solemn procession,
clad in a suit of white velvet and silver, adorned with
pearls and diamonds. The trappings of his horse were
crimson and gold embroidered with pearls. The progress
of the procession was very slow, lasting from noon till
nightfall; for in every open space was a raised platform
hung with gay curtains, where a company of actors, acrobats,
or singing children would give some kind of exhibition
which the King must stay to watch. One thing that we
must suppose he particularly liked was a wonderful tightrope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
walker. But after all, he was only a little nine-year-old
boy, and you can imagine that he was very tired when
the long day was over and he went home to bed.</p>

<p>Next day at nine Edward was on his way to Westminster
Abbey for the long and splendid ceremony of the coronation,
at which he was formally presented to the people and
crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury. After two more
days of feasting and celebration, the young King settled
down to a quiet life again. But now it was a very lonely
life and not so happy a one. He saw little of his sisters;
and though he went on with his lessons, they were often
interrupted by the business of the state. For though he
had no real power, and the Lord Protector actually ruled
England, yet the little boy had to go through the form of
approving or disapproving of what was done.</p>

<p>Now the Duke of Somerset was very ambitious, and since
he had so much of the power of a king, he began to act and
to talk as if he were really king. This made some people
angry and other people jealous. One of the jealous ones
was Lord Seymour, the Protector's brother. Somerset was
very stern with Edward, and kept him very short of money,
so Seymour tried to win the young King's liking by kindness
and by gifts of pocket-money, which kings like as well as
other boys. But Seymour's enemies were too strong for
him; he was shut up in the tower, and Somerset so influenced
the child king that he consented to have his kind
uncle condemned to death. It seems a pity that a boy so
wise and good should have been so cold-hearted. It must
have been because all the men around him were hard and
cold; if he had only not been a king he might have been
warm and loving and full of gratitude for kindness.</p>

<p>Meantime Somerset went on being more and more proud
and ambitious and making more and more people hate him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Finally, after he had put down two rebellions by very
cruel means, another nobleman, the Duke of Northumberland,
formed a plot to kill Somerset and become Protector
himself. When Somerset heard this, he went to Edward's
palace, and frightened the boy into going away with him
on his flight. He thought that the people would spare his
own life out of love and respect for Edward, and like a
coward he used the young King as a shield. It was dusk
when they set out, and the crowded courtyard of the palace
was alight with moving torches and glittering armor. Confused
and alarmed by the champing of the horses, the
rattle of steel, and the sound of voices, the boy cried out,
"I pray, good people, be good to us and to our uncle."</p>

<p>Then Somerset made a long, angry speech to the people,
telling them that he knew of the plot to kill him and seize
the King. He finished his speech in truly cowardly fashion.
"I tell you," he said, "if anything is attempted against me,
here," pointing to the King, "is he who shall die before me."</p>

<p>The King and his uncle fled away safely to Windsor.
They rode almost all night, and arrived at dawn. Nothing
was ready for them; they were not expected, and there was
neither food nor fire. The October nights were cold, and
the boy, who was never strong, fell ill of cold and weariness
and fear. At Windsor he lived closely guarded, and felt as
if he were in prison, for the place was then only a fortress,
not a beautiful castle as it is now.</p>

<p>He did not stay long at Windsor, however. Somerset's
enemies came after him, and presented to Edward all their
charges against the cruel, ambitious Protector. Edward
seems to have listened to them very readily, and not to
have tried to save his uncle when he was taken and shut up
in the Tower of London. And later, when Somerset was
beheaded, the King cared little about his uncle's fate. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
seems strange that so lovable a boy should have said not
one word of regret, even though he had never liked his uncle.</p>

<p>So, in the midst of anxiety and strife and scenes that
hardened his boyish heart, Edward grew to be fifteen years
old. He was now beginning to take great interest in the
government, and to show that he had a mind and will of
his own. Yet, King though he was, he still went on with
lessons. So earnest was he that he was held up to all the
boys of England, as an example. At the same time, however,
he liked to play, though he had sadly little chance for it.
He played a game something like baseball, and tennis, and
was fond of archery as a sport.</p>

<p>You will be interested to read what were the things that
a boy who was to be a king had learned by the time he was
fifteen. He could speak and write Latin and French as
well as English. He read Greek, Italian, and Spanish.
He had studied the geography of his own country thoroughly,
and knew all about the chief ports of England,
Ireland, Scotland, and France. He had studied fortifications,
and the places where they needed to be built or
strengthened. He astonished his advisers by the intelligence
with which he could talk about affairs of state.</p>

<p>It seems likely, does it not, that Edward would have
made an excellent King if ever he had taken the government
into his own hands? For the only fault that shows
plainly in him is his coldness of heart. But he had never
been strong, and before he was sixteen he became very ill,
as a result of a cough that he had had for a long time. He
had not strength to fight off the disease; so, patiently and
gently as he had lived, the boy King died. He had had a
chance to be neither a real boy nor a real King.</p>

<p>One day President Lincoln was met in the park between
the White House and the War Department by an irate,
crippled soldier, who was swearing in a high key, cursing the
Government from the President down. Mr. Lincoln
paused and asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Matter enough," was the reply. "I want my money.
I have been discharged here, and can't get my pay."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln asked if he had his papers, saying that he
used to practice law in a small way, and possibly could
help him. The soldier rather ungraciously said that he
had the papers.</p>

<p>My friend and I stepped behind some convenient shrubbery
where we could watch the result. Mr. Lincoln took
the papers from the hands of the angry soldier, and sat
down with him at the foot of a convenient tree, where he
examined them carefully, and writing a line on the back,
told the soldier to take them to Mr. Potts, Chief Clerk of
the War Department, who would doubtless attend to the
matter at once.</p>

<p>After Mr. Lincoln had left the soldier, we stepped out
and asked him if he knew whom he had been talking with.
"Some ugly old fellow who pretends to be a lawyer," was
the reply. My companion asked to see the papers, and
on their being handed to him, pointed to the indorsement
they had received. To the soldier's great surprise and
confusion, this indorsement read:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_DESERT_INDIANS_FIRE_BED" id="THE_DESERT_INDIANS_FIRE_BED">THE DESERT INDIANS' "FIRE BED"</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>You may have one minute in which to read this selection.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Indians of our "American Sahara" are compelled by
circumstances to overcome conditions not encountered by
their brothers of the plains and mountains.</p>

<p>The "fire bed" is among the most useful and original
methods employed by them to "sleep warm", in the "open",
as in fall and spring the nights are very cold.</p>

<p>A shallow trench is "scooped out" in the sand, about six
feet in length, three feet wide, and six or eight inches deep.
The sand is "banked up" on the sides, and a fire is then
made in the "pit", covering the entire length. This not
only warms the bottom but the banked sides as well.</p>

<p>After the fire has burned long enough to warm the sand
thoroughly, the larger unburned sticks are thrown out, but
all live coals are left in the pit. The sand on the sides is
now covered over the coals to a depth of about four inches.
The "sleeper" will then lie down in the warm sand; and,
if he possesses a blanket, he will throw it over him, thus
keeping in the heat, and will sleep warm.</p>

<p>I have tried this out myself many times, both upon the desert
and in the mountains, and have never suffered from the cold.</p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Pietro Vittori was playing in the shade of an olive grove
on a mountain side that overlooked the sea near Naples.
Just below him was a white road that stretched away into
the distance for many miles. Far below the road the blue
water sparkled in the sunshine. It was a beautiful spot.
Pietro, who had never been far from the olive grove and
the mountain side, supposed that all the world was like it.</p>

<p>As he looked at the road, he saw a little cloud of dust in
the distance; soon a motor car moved slowly along the road
until it came to a stop. The driver and a man on the seat
behind him got out and busied themselves about the car.
They looked at the long slope of the road before them and
shook their heads.</p>

<p>Drawn by curiosity, Pietro moved nearer and nearer
until he stood beside the road. He could see that something
was wrong, but he understood no word that the strangers
spoke. Suddenly the glance of the man fell on the bright-eyed,
barefoot lad, and he asked Pietro a question. His
voice was kindly, but Pietro could only shake his head.
Then the man laughed and patted Pietro's brown curls.
He led the boy to the side of the car, and pointed to a tank
beneath the seat of the driver.</p>

<p>This time Pietro understood; he knew that the tank
contained the wonderful fluid that made the car go. This
car could go no farther because the supply of the wonderful
fluid was used up. It was all plain enough, and he knew
what he could do to help. His dark eyes shone brightly
as he looked up at the man.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">"Si, Si, Signore!" He Cried Eagerly</span></p>

<p>"Si, si, signore!" he cried, eagerly; and in an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
more he was flying up the long slope, until at last he was
out of sight round a curve. The driver of the car started
to follow him, but soon gave up the attempt, for it was
very hot. All the way to the village Pietro ran as fast as
his bare feet would carry him&mdash;two kilometres or more.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour before Pietro came hurrying back.
With him was the man from the shop in the village, and
he bore a filled can in either hand. The travelers were
patiently waiting. They could do nothing else, for their
only hope lay in Pietro, unless by chance another motor
car should come along.</p>

<p>When they were ready to start again, the man patted
Pietro's curly head once more, and slipped some bright
silver coins into his hand&mdash;to the great surprise of Pietro,
who had never seen other coins than those made of copper.
Then the man leaped to his seat, and the whole party waved
their hands to Pietro, and called out gayly to him in their
strange language; then the car sped out of sight. Then
Pietro hurried up through the olive grove to his little
home, where the bright silver coins surprised his parents
even more than they had surprised him.</p>

<p>Now that was only a small adventure; but adventures
were few in Pietro's life, and so he thought of it often through
the weeks and months that followed. A year later, with
his parents and his brothers and sisters, he went over the
mountains to Naples, and sailed in a great ship across the
ocean to Boston; and all that meant so many adventures
that he almost forgot his long run over the hot and dusty
road to help the strangers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Pietro had lived in the North End of Boston about two
years, when he had another adventure. Late one afternoon,
toward the end of November, he was walking slowly
along the street on his way home from school. His heart
was heavy. At school he had just been learning the story
of Thanksgiving, and he had heard much about Thanksgiving
celebrations; but he knew that there would be no
Thanksgiving dinner in the crowded little rooms where he
lived, for the family was large, and his father had long been
without work.</p>

<p>As two men passed him, one said to the other, "How
this part of Boston has changed! I thought I could take
you straight to the Old North Church, but I seem to be
getting lost."</p>

<p>Pietro sprang to the man's side. "I know the way!"
he cried. "Let me show you! And I can tell you all
about the church where Paul Revere hung the lanterns."</p>

<p>The two men looked down, and laughed. "That is the
way with the little Italian boys; they soon become real
Americans," said the one who had spoken first. "We
shall be glad to have you guide us," he added to Pietro.</p>

<p>So Pietro proudly walked before them, and led the way,
first to the historic church, and then to the old cemetery
on Copp's Hill, near by. All this time the man was
watching him curiously. "I think you and I have met
before," he said at length. "Do you remember me?"</p>

<p>For the first time Pietro looked long and hard at the man's
face. Then he cried out, "Yes, yes! I did not see before!
You were the man in the car that stopped on the Amalfi
road." He fairly danced for pleasure that the strange man
had remembered him so long. Then he hurried on: "See!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
I can talk with you now! I am an American! I go to
school!"</p>

<p>"You see," said the man laughingly, as he turned to his
friend, "I can remember the face of a bright Italian boy
better than I can the streets of my own city."</p>

<p>Then he told his friend of the help that Pietro had given
when the motor car stopped on the Italian mountain side.
With a few questions, he drew from Pietro his own story,
and he watched the brown-eyed boy closely as they talked.</p>

<p>"Pietro," he said, at last, "I like you, and I want to be
your friend. Keep on in school and study. Come and
see me to talk things over once in a while. I'll be able
to help you when it is time for you to go to work. In the
meantime I can find work for your father." He gave
Pietro his address, and checked the words of thanks that
came pouring out. "And this," the man went on, "will
give you all a Thanksgiving dinner as a reward for your
work as guide this afternoon."</p>

<p>A bill was pressed into Pietro's hand, and the men
hurried on. Pietro stood where they left him, and looked
first at the bill in his hand, and then at the two men, who
turned and waved their hands as they went round a corner.</p>

<p>So it came about that the fortunes of the Vittori family
took a sudden change for the better, and there was a happy
Thanksgiving dinner in their tenement&mdash;all as a result of
Pietro's cheerful readiness to be of help three years before,
when strangers were in trouble on an Italian mountain side.</p>

<h2><a name="FATHER_DOMINO" id="FATHER_DOMINO">FATHER DOMINO</a></h2>


<p>It was the early spring time. The snow banks were
melting away, leaving the brown earth soft enough for the
flowers to push through as soon as they felt the warmth
of the sun.</p>

<p>Across the high hill, which sloped down to the river,
came a pair of foxes. The splendid Silver Fox, with a
black mark across the eyes like a mask, was called Domino.
The dainty little lady fox by his side, with a red coat and
an elegant ruffle of white, was Snowyruff. They had met
one day in the woods, and chosen each other for mates
and friends for life, as is the way of foxes. Now they were
searching through the woods for a place to build their home.</p>

<p>Snowyruff looked about the piney glade, nosed the
ground, then began to dig. It was her way of saying,
"I am satisfied. We'll set up housekeeping here."</p>

<p>She did not know that she had chosen the same sunny slope
on which Domino himself had lived as a tiny cub, but she
did know that it was a fine place for a home for a family
of foxes. The hillside would be sheltered and warm; the
den door would be hidden by the pine thicket near.</p>

<p>The deep snow and deep leaves had kept the earth soft
enough for her to dig, so she worked away with a will.
Domino sat on the hill and kept guard for an hour, then
he took her place and worked while Snowyruff kept watch.
So, working together, they built their home; a cozy, well-hidden
den it was, too. No eye could detect it, though
within a dozen feet; and as the warm spring sunshine set
the grass growing, it was better hidden each day.</p>

<p>The pair were more and more careful not to be seen
near the den. At last one day Snowyruff said to Domino:
"Keep away now!" and he kept away from the den for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
days. While he was absent a wonderful thing happened:
Five little foxes were born! When Snowyruff left them to
slip down to the river for a cooling drink of water, Domino
was there on the bank watching. She said to him in plain
Fox language: "You must not come home yet," so he
crouched with his head flat on the leaves, and she hurried
back to the den.</p>

<p>The next day when she was hungry, she ate some of the
food which they had stored up in the dry sand of the side
chamber of the den. Two days later, she went to the door,
and there was a pile of food&mdash;Domino had stolen down
and left it for her and their babies. After that, every day,
there was food at the door, or hidden in the grass near by.</p>

<p>When the cubs were nine days old their eyes opened,
they whimpered less, and Snowyruff felt it safer to leave them.
Domino now came in to see his family, and a proud father
he was. He guarded them with the greatest care, and was
as devoted to them as Mother Snowyruff herself.</p>

<p>When they were about a month old, the little toddlers
were brought out into the sunlight in front of the den.
There they romped and wrestled and raced with each other.
Sometimes they chased flies or bumble-bees, sometimes
they made a fine game of catching Mother's tail, or tussled
over a dried duck's wing.</p>

<p>As the days passed and the young foxes grew stronger,
Domino and Snowyruff began teaching them to find food
for themselves. Live game was brought home each day.
Sometimes a frog, or a fat field mouse, was brought, and
then turned loose for the youngsters to re-capture. Once
Domino called, "Chur-chur-chur," and when the rollicking
cubs came tumbling over one another, he dropped a live
muskrat in their midst. They pounced on it, but the muskrat
was a desperate fighter. It seemed for a time that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
would win, but the father and mother only looked on.
They must let their children learn to do hard things for
themselves, so they waited until one cub was strong enough
and quick enough to lay the muskrat low.</p>

<p>The happy growing days went by, and the cubs had not
learned the meaning of fear. One day Domino was
returning home with food. Five little black noses, ten
little beady eyes, set in woolly heads, were bunched at the
den door. Suddenly the bay of a hound sounded near and
Domino leaped on a stump to listen. There was no mistake;
the hound was coming nearer the home place. Snowyruff
warned the little ones, and Domino loped bravely out to
meet his enemy. He showed himself boldly, and even
barked defiance at the big hound, then dashed away,
leading him farther and farther from the den.</p>

<p>Domino ran hard for an hour, then began trying to throw
the hound off his trail, but it was not easy. The hound
was swift and keen in following the trail, and though he
doubled, crossed, and tried every trick he knew, Domino
could not throw him off. The fox ran lightly ahead, the
hound crashing heavily after him, baying loudly. At last
Domino led his enemy along a narrow ledge which ran at
the edge of a cliff overhanging the river.</p>

<p>On they went. Domino was growing very tired. His
steps were lagging so that the hound was gaining upon
him at every jump. Up and up they went; Domino went
slower still. The hound could see him just ahead. He
drew closer with each bound. At last Domino reached the
top of the cliff. His black coat gleamed against the sky.
He could go no farther; it was the end of the trail. The
hound plunged forward, and leaped at the fox; but Domino
sprang lightly aside, and the hound plunged headlong
over the rugged cliff. He was hurled down into the icy
flood below. He swam out as best he could, battered and
bleeding, and limped home, whining with pain. Domino
turned back and ran to the den, where five little black
noses, ten little beady eyes, set in five little woolly heads,
waited for their father.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOLE_AWAKES" id="THE_MOLE_AWAKES">THE MOLE AWAKES</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>One of the facts discovered by a student of nature is that
every part of an animal's body is fitted to perform its special
task, and to help the animal live in the surroundings where it
finds its home. Notice three ways in which the mole's bodily
equipment is fitted to the life he leads.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Dig" is expressed in every line of the mole's body.
Digging is his life-work, and to this Nature has adapted
his every organ. His eyes are of no use in this underground
life, and so they have dwindled away until externally there
is little sign of them. Objects he probably never sees with
any distinctness, though he still can tell light from darkness.
But he seems to recognize light only to avoid it. In the
darkness of his tunnels not only would his eyes be useless,
but dirt would be apt to get into them while he is digging;
so they are gradually leaving him.</p>

<p>The ears, too, or that part of them that projects from
the head, would be in the way. So they have been discarded.
The inner and most important part of the ear,
however, still remains, and the mole hears quite well.</p>

<p>His most remarkable difference from ordinary animals
is in the arms. These are very short, and the hands are
broad, hard, and horny, and have very firm claws. When I
catch a good, vigorous mole, I find I scarcely have force
enough in my thumb and forefinger to hold his front feet
together. He can often separate them in spite of all my
straining. His other muscles are comparatively weak.
The hands have been altered into great shovels, and when
he tries to walk over smooth, level ground or on a floor he
moves with odd, quick steps, resting on the sides and not
on the palms of his hands. He reminds one of a wound-up
toy that is held in the air and allowed to run down. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
when he gets under the sod, the heaving line that forms
over him as he digs shows that there he is in his proper
element. Most animals would get dirty leading such a
life, but you never see a cleaner animal than the mole.
He comes out of the loose earth and squirms about a little,
and he is clean. His smooth gray fur, shading to a silvery
hue when it is ruffled, is very short and close and exceedingly
dry. Indeed I know no animal with a more velvety
coat. He would be a delightful pet to handle were it not
for his ceaseless wriggling. Then too he carries a strong
musky odor. This latter, indeed, is his only defence and I
fear it is a poor one. Certainly it does not usually deter
a dog from snapping him up. But perhaps it is meant
for his friends rather than his foes. Friendly moles may
scent each other from afar.</p>

<p>The mole is a reversible machine. He can run forward
or backward at will. Probably as a result of this habit, it
is wonderful how alike are the two ends of his body, his nose
and his tail. Each is slender and each is bare; each is very
sensitive, and the tail is just about as long as the nose.
I think he uses whichever happens to precede, as a feeler,
when he is making his way through his tunnel. For once
having made a good big runway, he is very apt to keep on
using it through the season. I doubt not he is often forced
to travel backwards through his burrow. Then his tail
must serve him as an effective guide.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_COUNT_AND_THE_ROBBERS" id="THE_COUNT_AND_THE_ROBBERS">THE COUNT AND THE ROBBERS</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Ever since the World's War began, we have heard a great
deal about Belgium, the gallant little country which saved
the world, and Holland, her sturdy neighbor which stayed
neutral. Both these small countries were once called the
Netherlands. "Nether" means "lower"; you can see how
suitable a name "lower lands" is for a country that is much
of it below sea level. Until the fifteenth century this country
had no one ruler, but was cut up into many little parts, each
governed by a duke or count. Here is the story of a kind count,
who ruled in one part of the land in the twelfth century.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the twelfth century there ruled in Bruges a certain
Count Bordewyn, whose fathers had reigned for many years
before him. Bruges, in those days, was one of the most
important centres of the Netherlands, and the count was
a kind and good man whose only thought was to make his
people happy. In order that they might not be afraid
to tell him their needs, he went about among them dressed
as a farmer and a peasant; and they, thinking he was one
of themselves, spoke out freely in his presence. One night
he left his castle, and, poorly dressed, went out into the
country to see if there was any good he could do. It was a
dark, cold night, and after walking for some time he was
glad to see the lights of a house in the distance. When he
reached the building, he knocked at the door and went in.
He found himself at a wedding-party given by a farmer
whose daughter had been married that day. The good
count was very happy to be of the party, and without
letting the people know who he was, he sat down with them
and sang and feasted. It was very late when they, much
against their will, let him leave them, and he walked back
through the lonely country, making plans for his people's
happiness.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a whistle, and five men rushed out
from a clump of trees and threw themselves upon him.
The Count struggled to the trees, set his back against one
and prepared to fight. The robbers were armed with
knives, but the Count had only a big stick. On they rushed
at him. He struck at the first one with all his strength,
and hit him so hard that he fell to the ground. Another
one crept up to his side, and would have cut his head open;
but the Count turned quickly, and, catching the stroke on
his stick, snatched the knife from the robber's hand, and
with a blow sent him to join his comrade senseless on the
ground. This left three against one, and the Count felt
his strength giving way under their blows. Still full of
courage, he swung the stick round his head to keep the
wretches at a distance, and, as loudly as he could, he prayed
to God to send him help. At this moment he saw dimly
outlined against the darkness a human figure. In its hands
it wielded a strange weapon, which soon was falling again
and again on the heads and shoulders of the three bandits
until they took to their heels and ran. At first the Count
thought it was some angel from heaven come to his help,
but as the figure drew nearer he saw that it was a farmer,
and that the mysterious weapon was a flail.</p>

<p>The Count and the farmer embraced each other, and for
a moment did not speak. Then said the Count, "My
brave fellow! How can I thank you? You have saved my
life!"</p>

<p>But the farmer would not listen to his thanks; "No, no,"
said he; "I have done only what you would have done
for me in the same circumstances, and nothing more need
be said. I take it that you are a merchant earning a living
for your wife and family, as I try to do for mine."</p>

<p>But the Count insisted that the farmer should ask some
favor. "Listen!" said he; "I am in the service of the
Count, and perhaps can do you some great good."</p>

</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Robbers Were Armed With Knives</span></p>

<p>For a time the farmer was silent, and then, hesitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
very much, he told the Count his dearest wish. "For
thirty years I have worked on a piece of land; with this
flail I have beaten the corn, and I have loved the farm as
my child. Yesterday my master died, and the land will
pass into strange hands and out of my care."</p>

<p>The Count had listened quietly to his story, and at last
spoke: "But, my friend, this is not such a difficult matter.
How would you like the land for your own?"</p>

<p>The poor farmer wept with emotion. "Really, is it
possible that you have such influence?" said he.</p>

<p>"Come to the castle to-morrow," said the Count, "and
ask for the Captain of the Guard."</p>

<p>And the farmer, mystified and wondering, went slowly
home. When his wife opened the door, she was very angry
with him for being so late; but Cornelius&mdash;that was the
farmer's name&mdash;explained what had happened, and although
the wife could scarcely believe that such good fortune
could be theirs, yet they went to bed full of hope.</p>

<p>At daybreak Cornelius dressed in his best and set off
for the castle, followed by the prayers and blessings of his
wife. When he arrived he was so frightened that he could
hardly speak to the big soldiers who guarded the door,
but at last he gave his message and asked to see the
Captain. He followed the soldier into a splendid hall
richly hung with tapestries, and soon the man whose life
he had saved came into the room. He was dressed so
beautifully in silk and cloth of gold that Cornelius hardly
recognized him, and when he did he was afraid to ask his
question. But his friend told him not to fear, that the
Count was favorable to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>He led the trembling Cornelius through many rooms and
at last stopped outside a big door. "In this hall you will
see the Count. Ask for what you wish," he said.</p>

<p>But Cornelius said he was so much afraid that he dared
not ask. "Besides, how shall I know the Count from all
his followers?" he inquired.</p>

<p>And the answer was that all the people in the room would
kneel, bare-headed, except Count Bordewyn himself. So
Cornelius followed his guide into the great hall where all
the Court was assembled in grandeur, and, looking round
him, he perceived that the only persons standing were
himself and the man whose life he had saved. Seeing this,
he at once knew that this man was the Count, and he flung
himself on his knees and begged forgiveness for his presumption
in speaking to him as he had done. But the
Count, taking his hands, raised him to his feet and embraced
him, and telling his Court the history of the previous night,
he commanded them to treat Cornelius with every respect.
He gave him the farm and land for his own, and stocked it
with grain and cattle.</p>

<blockquote><p>You are now going to read a chapter of history. It will
help you to see how our ancestors learned some things that are
very common to us today, but which had to be learned before
the wonderful comforts we enjoy were possible.</p>

<p>You will like to study history if you keep in mind that it
does not just tell of something that happened a long time ago,
but that it shows how our civilization with its homes and
schools and churches and government and our great railroads
and steamships and factories came into existence. The thing
we call civilization has grown and changed in thousands of years
much as you have grown and changed in the few years that
you can remember.</p>

<p>You will need to read this selection very carefully. Your
teacher will ask you the questions at the end and probably a
good many more. See if you can read it the first time so
thoroughly that you can answer all the questions. It will
help you very much if you will write topics as you go along.
In the fourth paragraph you will find a list of things that man
has always needed. If you use each of these things as a heading
and under it make a list of the steps of man's progress, you
will probably find that you have mastered the selection.</p></blockquote>

<p>History is the story of what men have done in the past.
It was not until men had learned how to write that they
could keep a record of what they did. But men lived upon
the earth for many thousand years before they knew how
to write. In that early time they learned how to do many
things which we are still doing and to make many things
which we are still making and using. In these ways they
did much to make life what it is for us.</p>

<p>How is it possible for us to know anything about what
life was like in those ancient times when men could not
write? Did you ever find an Indian arrow-head? Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
you have seen a collection of stone arrow-heads and axes.
These relics and others like them tell us many things about
the people who made them. Then there are people now
living, like the natives of Australia or some of the tribes of
American Indians, who still use, or used until very recently,
these crude stone implements, and who live very much as
our own ancestors lived many thousand years ago.</p>

<p>The earliest men lived but little better than the animals
in the forest about them. They were without shelter or
clothing and had only such food as they could find from
day to day. Men have either found or made everything
that we now have. Early man possessed a great advantage
over all the animals because he had a better brain and a
wonderful pair of hands with which he could make the
weapons, tools, and other things that he needed.</p>

<p>Men have always needed food, shelter, clothing, and the
means of protection against the dangers around them. It
took our early ancestors many thousand years to learn how
to provide themselves with these simple necessities of life.</p>

<p>At first men lived upon the roots, herbs, wild berries, and
fruits in the forest. Sometimes they found birds' nests in
the trees and ate the eggs or the young birds. Occasionally
they found a dead bird or animal and thus learned to like
the taste of flesh. They hunted for shellfish by the seashore
and caught fish in the streams and lakes. Then they
began to kill the smaller animals with stones or clubs and in
this way they became meat eaters. When men had learned
how to make knives, spears, and bows and arrows, they
could kill the larger animals and get a better supply of food.</p>

<p>For a long time all food was eaten raw, because the use
of fire was unknown. We do not know how man discovered
fire. He may have kindled it first from a tree set aflame by
the lightning. By and by he found that a spark could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
produced by striking two stones together in the right way
or that he could make a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood
together.</p>

<p>The making of fire was one of the most wonderful inventions
in the world. Men could now cook their food.
At first they roasted bits of meat before the blaze or in the
hot ashes. Later, when they had learned how to make
vessels that would hold water, they began to boil all kinds
of food over the fire.</p>

<p>For a long time men procured their food by hunting,
trapping, and fishing. During this time they began to
capture and tame the young of some of the wild animals.
Probably the dog was the first domestic animal. The cow
was also domesticated at a very early period. Man used
her meat and milk for food and her skin for clothing. He
made tools and implements out of her bones and horns.
No other animal has been more useful to him. The goat and
the sheep, the hog and the ass, and later the horse, were
tamed by early men long before real history began. After
these animals had been domesticated by the hunters and
trappers, some men became shepherds and herdsmen and
wandered from place to place with their flocks and herds in
search of the best pastures.</p>

<p>Presently another step was taken toward civilized life.
Men had long known that the seeds of some of the wild
grasses and plants were good to eat. Now some one noticed
that if these seeds were sown they sprang up and brought
forth many more seeds. Then it was discovered that the
seeds grew better and yielded a more abundant crop if
the ground were broken up and made soft before the seed
was sown. Because of these discoveries some men
began to be farmers. By cultivation, the wild grasses
which grew in the fields or beside the rivers were developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
into wheat, oats, barley, and rice, the great cereals of the
world.</p>

<p>When men began to procure their food by cultivating
the soil it became necessary for them to remain in the same
place in order to gather the harvest when it ripened. They
could no longer wander from place to place as they had
done when they were only hunters or shepherds. They
now began to live in permanent villages and to cultivate
the land lying near by. In this way the beginning of
farming led to a settled life and the making of permanent
homes.</p>

<p>Probably the earliest men had only such shelter from the
rain and protection from wild animals as the trees gave
them. After a time men began to live in dens and caves
in the earth. These people are called the "cave dwellers".
Still later men built huts by bending young trees together,
weaving branches between them, and covering the whole
structure with leaves and bark. When the hut was built
of poles covered with the skins of animals it became a tent.
Many of the people who wandered from place to place with
their flocks and herds dwelt in tents.</p>

<p>When men settled near the fields that they were beginning
to cultivate, they built permanent homes of stone
plastered with mud or of bricks made of clay and dried in
the sun. The roofs were covered with brush or timber.
Then fire places and rude chimneys were added to these
simple houses, and in other ways man's dwelling place was
gradually improved.</p>

<p>The first clothing was probably made from the leaves of
trees or from grasses matted together. When man became
a good hunter he wore the skins of the animals that he
killed. The ancestors of all of us were once clad in skins.
The women of those early days used to cure the skins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
small animals by drying them. They then made garments
of them by sewing them together with needles of bone and
the sinews of animals for thread.</p>

<p>The women scraped and worked the large skins until
they were soft and pliable. These they used for clothing,
or for blankets, or for the covering of their tents. Still
later, the women learned to spin yarn from wool sheared
from the sheep and from the thread of the flax which they
were beginning to raise. The next step was to weave the
yarn and the thread into woolen and linen cloth.</p>

<p>It was because early man had the mind to invent and
the hands to make the weapons, tools, and utensils which
he needed that he was able to make such progress in procuring
food, shelter, and clothing.</p>

<p>Man's first weapon was a club. A stone which he used
to crack nuts with probably was his earliest tool. At first
he simply found stones of the right shape for his purpose.
Then he began to chip a piece of flint until it had a rough
edge. Now he had a hatchet as well as a hammer. Because
he held this hatchet in his hand it has been called a
fist-hatchet. A great many of these fist-hatchets have
been found. In the course of time man learned how to use
thongs of rawhide to bind handles to his fist-hatchets. Now
he had axes and spears.</p>

<p>It was a great day in the long climb toward civilized
ways of living when some unknown inventor made the
first bow. With arrows tipped with sharp bits of stone,
man could now kill the larger animals. Stone knives were
used to skin the game. Flint scrapers and other implements
were very useful in scraping and softening the skins
to fit them for use.</p>

<p>By using pieces of flint with rough edges as saws and
files, men began to make tools of horn, bones, and shells.
They now possessed daggers and hammers of horn and awls
and needles of bone.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Evolution of the House</span></p>

<p>For many thousand years, stone arrow-heads, knives, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
axes were made with rough, chipped edges. This time is
sometimes called the Old Stone Age. When men had
learned to make better tools of their stone knives and axes
by grinding and polishing them to a smooth, sharp edge,
they had entered upon the New Stone Age.</p>

<p>The next great forward step in human progress was taken
when men discovered metals and began to use them. Copper
was the first metal used, but it was soon found that it was
too soft for making many articles.</p>

<p>Presently it was discovered that if a little tin were mixed
with the copper it made a harder metal called bronze. So
many weapons, tools, and ornaments were made of bronze
that the time when it was used is called the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Iron is the most useful of all the metals. It is much
harder than bronze and better suited in every way for
making tools and implements. It took man a long time to
learn how to use it, because it is not so easy to work as copper
and bronze. When man made this "king of metals" his
servant, he traveled a long, long way on the road which
leads to civilization.</p>

<p>The men invented the weapons and some of the tools of
the earliest ages. But it is probable that the women first
made many useful tools and utensils. Women wove the
first baskets to use in gathering and carrying berries, nuts,
and other articles of food. They used to cover fish with
clay in order to bake them in the coals and they noticed
how the fires hardened the clay. Then by molding clay
over baskets so that they could be hung over the fire, women
gradually learned how to make earthenware pots and bowls.
Afterwards they cut spoons, ladles, and drinking cups from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
shells, gourds, and the horns of animals. In these ways
our foremothers made their first cooking utensils and their
first dishes for holding and serving food and drink.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus147.png" alt="Clay Bowls and Woven Baskets" title="Clay Bowls and Woven Baskets" />
</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Clay Bowls and Woven Baskets</span></p>

<p>Women were not only the first basket-makers and potters.
They were also the first spinners and weavers. They
ground the first grain into flour with mortars and pestles of
stone. Later they made simple mills for this purpose. In
fact, women who lived before the dawn of history, began
nearly all the household arts and crafts and in this way
helped all the people who have lived since then.</p>

<p>Our earliest ancestors, like ourselves, found it necessary
to carry things from place to place. But they lived long
before the days of the railroad and the steamship. The
first burdens were borne by the women. They followed
the men who hunted, and carried the meat and the hides
of the slain animals back to the camp. After the dog, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
donkey, and the horse had been tamed, articles to be
transported were packed upon their backs or dragged upon
the ground behind them. Sleds were made in the northern
lands. Canoes and boats were built by the dwellers by
the rivers and the sea. Last of all, the wheeled cart was
invented. All these things are older than history.</p>

<p>We often call our own time the age of invention. The
steam engine, the telegraph, and the many uses of electricity
are all modern. They have made wonderful changes in
our ways of living. But these changes in our lives are not
as remarkable as were those made in the lives of our earliest
ancestors so long ago by such inventions as the fishhook and
the bow and arrow, and such discoveries as how to make
fire, how to make pottery, how to domesticate animals and
plants, and how to smelt and work the metals.</p>

<p>Nowadays children have homes and are cared for by
their parents. Among the very earliest men there was
nothing like our homes or our families. Each person found
his own food and took care of himself. Of course, mothers
cared for their babies, but nobody took care of a child after
he was large enough to find his own food. Then he had to
shift for himself. When he wanted his breakfast or his
dinner he dug roots or hunted for berries, nuts, or acorns.
Sometimes he feasted upon birds' eggs or upon a rabbit or
a squirrel which he had caught. The honey which he
found in the nests of the wild bees was his only candy and
he was apt to get well stung in taking it. He lived in constant
fear of the wild animals around him and usually slept
in a tree for safety. He spent his entire life in this way.</p>

<p>There are many things that people can do better by
working together. It took many years for early men to
learn to help one another. When they became cave
dwellers and learned how to make fire, the first family
group began to be formed. This group was called the clan.
The clan simply means those who were kin to each other;
that is, a number of men and women who believed that
they were descended from a common ancestor. At first
the common ancestor was a woman, the clan mother. In
those days, relationship was always counted on the mother's
side. When a man married he went to live with the clan
of his wife. In the course of time groups of clans came to
be called tribes.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Development of Transportation</span></p>

<p>A long time later, after the animals had been domesticated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and men had come to own flocks and herds and other
things that we call property, the father became the head of
the family, as we know it today. Our kind of a family with
the father as its head existed before history began.</p>

<p>Words had to be invented, just as tools were. At first
men had no language. Very slowly they gave names to the
things about them and learned to talk to each other.
Mothers sang jingles and lullabies to their babies. Around
the campfire at night men told how they had hunted the
wild beasts. Women talked as they gathered and prepared
food or dressed the skins of the wild animals. Mothers
wanted their children to be brave and wise, so they told
them stories about the bravest and wisest of their clan in
the olden time. Perhaps this is why children, and older
people too for that matter, have always been fond of stories.
In these ways languages grew and the simple beginnings of
literature were made.</p>

<p>People have always been fond of ornaments. The earliest
men wore necklaces of teeth and claws. Later they made
beads of bronze or of gold. The women tried to make their
baskets and their clothes as beautiful as possible by coloring
them with natural dyes. Some of the men liked to draw
pictures of wild animals upon pieces of bone or upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
walls of their homes in the caves. People learned to count
upon their fingers, and to use various parts of their bodies,
like the finger, the hand, and the arm, as measures of
length. For example, the cubit of which we read in the
Bible was the distance from the elbow to the end of the
middle finger. Our arts and sciences have grown from
such crude and simple beginnings.</p>

<p>Our early ancestors lived in fear of many things about
them. They thought that fire, the rivers, the sea, the sun,
and many other natural objects were alive and could harm
them or help them. So they offered gifts to all these things
and prayed to them for help. Early men also believed that
the souls of their ancestors lived after death, and that these
ancestors could help them or harm them. They thought
that if they offered gifts of food, and drink at the graves of
their dead, the spirits of the departed would be pleased and
would protect the living members of their families. If, on
the other hand, the dead were neglected or forgotten they
would become evil spirits who might bring great misfortune
upon the living. They also thought that if the dead were
not properly buried they would become ghosts, haunting the
places they had known when they were alive. Because of
these ideas early men were very careful to worship their
ancestors. The first religions of the world grew out of these
beliefs and practices of primitive men with reference to
nature and to their own ancestors.</p>

<p>The table given below tells how much your savings will
amount to at four per cent interest compounded semi-annually.
One dollar a month is a little less than twenty-five cents a
week. From this table, answer the following questions:</p>

<p>1. If you save one dollar a month, how much will you have
in three years? Five years? Eight years? Ten years?</p>

<p>2. If you save four dollars a month&mdash;less than a dollar a
week&mdash;how much will you have in six years? Ten years?</p>

<p>3. If you save ten dollars a month, how much will you have
in seven years? Ten years?</p>

<p>4. If you save five dollars a month for ten years, will you
have more or less than if you save ten dollars a month for five
years?</p>

<p>5. Can you explain to the class how to read the table?</p>

<h2><a name="HEROES_OF_HISTORY" id="HEROES_OF_HISTORY">HEROES OF HISTORY</a></h2>


<p>There were four children at the big second-story window
that looked out over the broad avenue where the historical
pageant was to pass; four children in very high spirits.
Of course they were excited and happy; it was a wonderful
place for seeing, and it was a wonderful parade that they
were to watch&mdash;a celebration of the ending of the great
World's War. The procession was to take the form of a
series of groups of figures representing great persons from
the history of the five important nations that had been
allies in the struggle. Alfred and Betty and Francis and
Dick had been talking for days about the great event.
They were sure that they would enjoy it, for though Alfred,
the oldest, was not thirteen yet, and Dick, the baby, was
but seven, they all thought they knew something about
history. And if they weren't able to recognize all the
characters in the pageant, they need only ask Aunt Eleanor,
who sat with them in the group at the window.</p>

<p>From far up the street came the sound of a band, and
all the watchers stood on tiptoe or craned their necks to
catch the first glimpse of the marching lines. It was a
regimental band, with the colors carried proudly. How
everyone cheered for the lines of khaki soldiers who followed
next! Then noisy enthusiasm gave place to eager and
interested questions about the first historical group. And
nobody in all the watching crowd had more questions to
ask than our windowful of children.</p>

<p>The center of the strangely costumed company was a
blonde, bearded, kingly figure, wearing a crown of gold,
a coat of mail, and a long, flowing cloak. One hand was
on the jeweled hilt of his sword; the other clasped to his
breast a parchment-bound book. Behind him were two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
attendants. Aunt Eleanor, watching her charges with as
much interest as they watched the street, saw that they
looked puzzled, though Alfred was trying to pretend that
he knew the name of the king.</p>

<p>"You ought to feel honored, Alfred," said Aunt Eleanor.
"That splendid looking Englishman has the same name as
you."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the boy, pretending that he had understood
all the time. "It's Alfred the Great. He," turning
loftily to the younger children, who couldn't be expected
to know so much, "was the first really important king of
England. He was a great fighter, and finally conquered
all his enemies. But once he had to run away, after a
battle, and hide in a peasant's hut in disguise. The woman
there didn't know who he was, and she went away and
left him to watch some cakes that were on the fire baking.
He was so busy thinking about how to get his kingdom
back that he let them burn, and when she came back she
scolded him."</p>

<p>"Those queer round things that the other man is carrying
on that wooden tray must be the cakes," exclaimed
Betty.</p>

<p>"Yes," said their aunt. "And do you see the musician
with the harp? That is to remind us that King Alfred was
fond of music, and did all he could to help it flourish. He
was more than just a fighter; he wanted his people to learn
all they could, so he started schools, and he founded Oxford
College, the oldest college in England. Don't you see the
book in his hand to show that he was fond of reading?
It was very unusual in those days, a thousand years ago,
for even a king so much as to know how to read. But
right after him in the procession is another warrior king
who loved learning and music and all the arts of peace."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>And sure enough, as King Alfred of England passed out
of sight, there followed another kingly figure, very tall and
clad all in iron. Helmet, shield, gloves, boots&mdash;all were
iron, and the wearer was terrible to look at, so strong and
merciless he seemed. Behind him came a group of horsemen
carrying iron spears with glittering points and with
gay banners fluttering from their shafts.</p>

<p>"Well," said Betty, "he may have loved peace, but he
doesn't look it. Who is he, anyway?"</p>

<p>"He represents the first great king of France, Charlemagne,
a name that means Charles the Great. He lived
at about the same time with Alfred. He was a great conqueror
and overcame all his neighbors. He even led a
huge army across the Alps and conquered the northern
part of Italy. There he had himself crowned with a famous
Iron Crown that was worn by the king of that country.
But when he was not fighting he was building beautiful
palaces and chapels, and encouraging all the learned men
of the country."</p>

<p>"There seem to be a lot of soldiers in this parade," said
nine-year-old Francis, "Here comes another. Who's he?"</p>

<p>"He must be a Crusader," said Betty, "for he has a red
cross on his white cloak, and armor underneath it."</p>

<p>"He's a king, too," said little Dick. "He's got a crown
on. What's a Crusader, Auntie? And is he one?"</p>

<p>"The Crusaders lived about three hundred years later
than Alfred and Charlemagne. In that time the Turks&mdash;yes,
the same kind of Turks whom you have heard about as
persecuting the poor little Armenian children&mdash;had come
into possession of the Holy Land in Palestine. All the
Christian countries wanted to drive them out, so that
heathen might not be in possession of Jerusalem and the
Holy Sepulcher. So from France and Italy and Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and England great armies went out to fight against the
Saracens, as the Turks in Palestine were then called. And
they wore red crosses on their cloaks to show that they were
going on a holy war."</p>

<p>"Did they get the land back?" asked Francis.</p>

<p>"Why, no, silly," cried Alfred. "Don't you remember
just last year General Allenby conquered Jerusalem, in the
big war? The Turks had been there all that time. But
wasn't that Crusader," nodding toward the rider disappearing
in the distance, "somebody special?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. You aren't the only boy here that has a
king's name. This was a king with the same name as
Dick&mdash;Richard of England, whom his people loved to call
the Lion Hearted, because he was so brave. I could tell
by the banner with the lion on it that floated above his
head. There are lots of fine stories about King Richard.
One tells how he was captured by an enemy on the way
home from one of the Crusades and kept shut up in a
tower for a year; and how he was found and rescued by a
friend of his who was a sweet singer, and who went about singing
a little song that the king loved, until at last he heard
the king's voice sing in answer to him from the tower
window. Then there's a story of how he came back to
England in disguise, and kept his wicked brother John from
stealing his throne. Some day you must read Sir Walter
Scott's famous novel, 'Ivanhoe,' which tells all about the
adventures of Richard in disguise."</p>

<p>A convenient gap in the procession had given Aunt
Eleanor time to tell the children this much about King
Richard; but now another group, a very soberly dressed
company, too, claimed their attention. The central figure
was not a king in armor this time, but a grave, determined
looking man clad in black velvet, with a deep lace collar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and a wide black hat and feather. The children at once
demanded his name.</p>

<p>"I must look at my program to find out who he is," said
their aunt. "Oh, yes; William of Orange. Both he and
his little country, Holland, have a wonderful story. Five
hundred years ago the lands that are now Belgium and
Holland belonged to Spain. As time went on the Spanish
king, Philip, oppressed them more and more cruelly, and
wouldn't let them have any freedom at all, either in politics
or religion. But they were a liberty-loving people, and
toward the end of the sixteenth century they rose in rebellion
against Spain. This stern-looking Hollander was
their greatest leader. He was called William the Silent,
because of an event early in his career. One day the
French king, who was in league with Spain, and who thought
Prince William was in sympathy with their side, betrayed
to him all the details of a secret plot. William was filled
with horror and very angry, but he kept perfectly still, and
didn't even show by the movement of an eyelash that he
was anything but friendly and interested. He was called
'silent', you see, not because he didn't talk much, but
because he could keep a secret."</p>

<p>"And was that when Holland and Belgium got to be
independent countries? And why aren't they all one
country, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the part that is Holland won its independence then,
though poor William was murdered before the fight was
finished. It was one of the earliest of European republics.
But the part that is Belgium came to terms with Spain
after William's death, and wasn't a separate country till
long after. You see, the Holland part was made up of
people of the Protestant religion, while the Belgian part,
like Spain, was Catholic."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose that's why he's in this procession, because
when he lived he really belonged to Belgium as well as to
Holland," said Alfred thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Betty, clapping her hands, "I know who
that next lot are! The lady in the ruff, with the little
jeweled band in her hair, must be Queen Elizabeth, and
those are her courtiers. Now every one of us has a namesake
in the pageant, except Francis."</p>

<p>"If I'm not mistaken," said her aunt, "Francis has a
namesake in this very group. Yes, surely&mdash;do you see
the man with the pointed beard and the model of a ship
in his hand? That is Sir Francis Drake, the great seaman.
Over and over his little ship went in chase of the Spaniards,
who were England's greatest enemies at this time. Elizabeth
ruled at the same time when the Dutch, too, were
fighting Spain. There was nothing too daring or dangerous
for Drake to attempt. He was the first Englishman to
sail around the world, a voyage which took more than two
years. Once he sailed right into a Spanish harbor and
burned all the Spanish ships there, which were being made
ready for an attack on England. And he and his friends,
bold adventurers like himself, laid the foundation of the
power of England on the sea."</p>

<p>"I suppose the man with the red velvet cloak is Raleigh,
and that's the cloak he spread down for Elizabeth to walk
on."</p>

<p>"Yes. And do you see that kind, merry-looking man in
black, with the simple white collar, carrying an actor's
mask in his hand? That must be Shakespeare, the greatest
writer of plays that ever lived. And I believe the man beside
him, holding a great roll of manuscript and a quill
pen, is Spenser, the poet who wrote a wonderful book called
the 'Faerie Queen' in honor of Queen Elizabeth."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've had somebody from France and Belgium and
England," said Betty. "I wonder if there won't be an
American pretty soon?"</p>

<p>"There couldn't have been an American yet, stupid,"
Alfred informed her, "because there weren't any people
in our part of America in Queen Elizabeth's time."</p>

<p>"Oh, so there weren't. There comes a soldier with an
Indian chief and an Indian girl close behind him&mdash;he must
be American, or the Indians wouldn't be there."</p>

<p>"Guess he's John Smith," spoke up Francis, "'cause I
know he had his life saved by Pocahontas&mdash;that's the
Indian girl. But I don't know what else he did."</p>

<p>"Oh, he was the leader of the first colony to be settled
by the English in this country. What colony was it,
Alfred? You can tell, surely."</p>

<p>"Of course, Jamestown, in Virginia. That was why the
Indians got mad at him, because the white men were taking
their lands away."</p>

<p>A burst of specially enthusiastic cheering arose from the
street. The reason for it was the approach of a kindly-faced
gentleman in dark gray coat and knee-breeches, with
silver shoe-buckles and broad-brimmed Quaker hat. It
was William Penn, of course, looking for all the world like
the statue on the high City Hall tower. There was no need
for Aunt Eleanor to give any information about him, for
these were Philadelphia children, who knew and loved the
founder of the "green country town" that had grown to
be so large a city. Nor was there any need to explain
about the next figure to arrive, a stately general on horseback,
in white wig, cocked hat, and Revolutionary uniform
of blue and buff. Behind him, in an old-fashioned carriage,
rode Betsy Ross, holding the newly adopted Stars and
Stripes, at which the men in the crowd doffed their hats.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>But the next figure puzzled our little group of children.
It was a very short man, stockily built, yet full of dignity.
He, too, wore a cocked hat, and a plain uniform. He
walked with head bent forward and hands clasped behind
him, and his piercing black eyes looked at the ground.
The children could not guess who he was, so Aunt Eleanor
had to tell them.</p>

<p>"That is the great French conquerer Napoleon Bonaparte.
He began life as an ordinary citizen, and won his
way to the very top by his wonderful military genius.
He won so many battles in command of the French armies,
after the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth
century, that the people chose him to be consul, a position
something like that of the president of a republic. Then
he loved power so that he got control of the government
and had himself made emperor, so that France wasn't a
republic any more. After that he set out to conquer all
of Europe, and he nearly succeeded. But one winter he
went to Russia, and the cold and snow almost entirely
destroyed his army; and he never could succeed in beating
England. It was the great English general, the Duke of
Wellington, who finally crushed Napoleon at the battle of
Waterloo&mdash;you've heard of that? Well, after that the
fallen Emperor was sent away to a little island, St. Helena,
that belonged to England, and there he was kept a prisoner
till the end of his life."</p>

<p>"He was something like the German Kaiser in the World's
War, wasn't he?" said Alfred. "He wanted to conquer
all Europe&mdash;and the United States, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll learn that every once in so often history
repeats itself. But we'll hope that the Kaiser's effort to
conquer the world will be the last of such things, and that
such a war may never be repeated."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, who is that rough looking man in the red flannel
shirt?" cried Betty.</p>

<p>"That very red shirt tells me who he is," said her aunt.
"Have you been wondering when we were going to have
one of the heroes of Italy? Well, this is an Italian patriot
named Garibaldi. About sixty years ago, when Italy was
struggling to get free from Austria, and to be an independent
nation, Garibaldi gathered together as many brave
soldiers as he could, in the southern part of the country,
and they marched to the help of their countrymen in a
time of very great need. As a part of their uniform they
wore red shirts. But one of the most interesting things
about Garibaldi is that when his country wanted to give
him a high position, he said he would rather go back to the
farm he had bought for himself, and live his life out as a
plain, ordinary man."</p>

<p>Little Dick had been keeping very still and listening,
for all the people in the parade had been those that he
never had heard of before. But suddenly he jumped to
his feet in excitement. He, like every other child in the
crowd, knew who was that tall, awkward, homely person
in the long black frock coat and the high silk hat. There
could be no mistaking that kind, sad face, with the patient,
farseeing eyes. Behind the great president rode two
soldierly figures&mdash;General Grant in his blue uniform, and
General Lee in the gray, on his beloved white horse,
Traveller. Nor could there be any mistaking of the
energetic figure in hunting dress that followed him, whose
face wore a smile that could not be spoiled by the heavy
eyeglasses that were so familiar a part of a well-known
countenance.</p>

<p>"Teddy," cheered the crowd, with the enthusiasm that
always is stirred by true, generous manliness.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon was growing late. One group remained,
with which the procession was to close. On horseback
rode a tall, soldierly figure, dressed in khaki, with an
officer's hat bearing royal insignia, and with his breast
covered with medals. A pair of keen blue eyes smiled out
of a clear-cut, earnest face. Behind him, in an automobile,
rode a thin, worn old man in the scarlet robe and close
scarlet cap of a cardinal.</p>

<p>"I need not tell you who they are," said Aunt Eleanor.
"They stand to us for the little country that in 1914 saved
the world by sacrificing herself. King Albert of Belgium
led his own armies into battle; his queen, Elizabeth, nursed
the wounded in the hospitals; and Cardinal Mercier
stayed with his people to cheer and comfort them."</p>

<p>"I think they are the greatest heroes of all," said Betty
softly.</p>

<p>"Any man is a hero, dear," said her aunt, "who spends
his life for the help and safety of his people, not thinking
what it costs himself."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SKELETON_IN_ARMOR" id="THE_SKELETON_IN_ARMOR">THE SKELETON IN ARMOR</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>In the poem that follows, the poet tells us of a strange and
fearful visitor that once came to him&mdash;the spirit of some
ancient viking of the Northland all dressed in armor and
carrying sword and shield.</p>

<p>In order to understand the poem, you must remember that
the vikings were bold sea-rovers and fierce warriors who set
out in their long swift boats in search after plunder and adventure.
Some of them are even said to have come over to
America long before Columbus ever dreamed of the new world.
The poem was suggested to Mr. Longfellow by the finding of
a skeleton clad in broken and rusted armor and buried in the
sands of the New England shore, and by a very ancient tower
that must have been built on the coast by the Northmen many
years before 1492. These two facts are true, but of course
the story that the poet made of them is merely a good story.</p>

<p>The poet's strange guest is one of these sea-robbers, who
tells how as a youth he had won the love of a blue-eyed
princess of the far North, only to find that her father forbade
their marriage. In the first stanza the poet asks a question;
the rest of the poem tells what the spirit of the viking said.</p>

<p>But you will want to read the story as the poet has told it.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="ACTING_FOR_THE_MOVIES2" id="ACTING_FOR_THE_MOVIES2">ACTING FOR THE MOVIES</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is another set of "movie" scenes. If you forget how
we played the first set, look on page 38 and see just what to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1. The blind man came slowly down the road, tapping
restlessly with his stick to guide him, and stopping every
now and again to listen for some fellow traveler who
might lead him to the town beyond the hill.</p>

<p>2. When they reached the open country, Aladdin had
to gather sticks and to build a great fire for the magician,
his uncle.</p>

<p>3. Aladdin's uncle stirred the fire until it blazed brightly.
Then he threw in some magical powder and as a thick
cloud of smoke arose, he made mystical signs over the fire,
and muttered some strange words that Aladdin could not
understand.</p>

<p>4. The Indian squatted down with legs crossed under
him and waited for the morning sun to enable him to take
up the trail again. Whenever the fire died away, he arose
silently and replenished the fuel, but except for these breaks,
one might have thought him a beautifully carved image.</p>

<p>5. None of the villagers knew Rip when he came back.
He was old and stiff and bent with age. He carried on
his shoulder his cherished musket, now useless and covered
with rust. As the people crowded round him he scanned
each face in turn, hoping to recognize some former familiar
acquaintance.</p>

<p>6. Sir Roger drew his sword, and taking advantage of
a corner in the garden wall, which might make a cowardly
attack in the rear impossible, he waited for the band to
approach. He knew that he was caught like a fox in this
narrow garden, and he looked eagerly to count how many
were against him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Hardly had the Sheriff ridden off with his men, before
Robin Hood came down the road, still dressed in the long
gown that old Mother Hobbes had given him, and walking
with the help of a cane, like an old woman, bent with years.</p>

<p>8. The savage raised his spear, and was about to cast
it, but some slight sound caused him to hesitate an instant
with the long shaft balancing lightly in his grasp.</p>

<p>9. An aged palmer came down the road. He was evidently
returning from a long pilgrimage, for his cloak was
old and tattered, his shoes were dusty and patched, and
every few steps he stopped to rest on his long staff.</p>

<p>10. The tinker, very tired from his run, sat down on a
large stone by the roadside. After looking cautiously
about, he took the king's letter from his pocket and read it.
Then folding it carefully again, and returning it to his
pocket, he rose and started down the road singing
cheerily.</p>

<p>11. He had tramped for three hours and had not discovered
a single familiar sign. There was no sign in the cloudy sky
to serve him as finger post. He climbed a tall tree that
seemed to promise a view of the surrounding landscape,
but everything was strange. He had read somewhere that
the trees are mossy and green on the north side, but when
he looked, even the trees seemed to be as uncertain as he.
In despair he sat down on a fallen log and waited.</p>

<p>12. White Eagle looked far out over the plain. Beyond
the now dry river basin and the green strip of brush and
scrubby trees that bordered it, he could trace the slow,
crawling wagon-train trailing out and winding like a lazy
serpent through the dust. When he had counted for a
second time to be sure, he drew back from the edge of the
bluff, built two tiny fires, and watched the thin columns
of smoke as they curled straight up in the air.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SAFEST_PLACE" id="THE_SAFEST_PLACE">THE SAFEST PLACE</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is a story of real human interest. We are all foreigners
here in America except the American Indians. The ancestors
of some of us came before those of others; and it is the duty
of those of us whose ancestors have been here the longest to help
the strange-looking, strange-speaking people who come to us
from Europe to feel at home in our country.</p>

<p>The government has tried hard to protect the immigrants
from dishonest people who have tried to cheat them out of
their earnings. One of the good things that came out of the
World's War was a knowledge on the part of almost all of our
people of the safe investments that the government offers in
bonds and thrift stamps.</p></blockquote>

<p>"At last the way is clear!"</p>

<p>Stefan spoke with much emotion as he counted the roll
of notes, clean and soiled, that lay before him on the table
in his little room in the over-crowded boarding house.</p>

<p>As he fingered the bills, he saw before him each detail
of the past two years&mdash;New York harbor with Liberty
flinging up her welcome torch; the thrill of arrival in the
city of his dreams; the days that followed, days of discouragement,
home-sickness, and poverty, among strangers speaking
strange tongues, with a medley of unfamiliar manners
and customs. He saw with vivid clearness the first dollar
he had earned, and he forgot the slow, painful processes of
saving&mdash;the self-denial and the sacrifice&mdash;in the picture of
what those sacrifices were to bring.</p>

<p>"She will come," he murmured. "On the same boat
perhaps. When she gets the ticket, she will leave that
war-threatened land and she will come to me." He smiled.
Then as his face suddenly clouded he started forward on
the rickety chair with a violence that threatened its frailness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
"If anything should happen! If I should lose the
money!"</p>

<p>Greatly disturbed he gathered up the precious bills as
though to shield them from possible loss. He rose to place
them in the old hiding place in his trunk, but that no
longer satisfied him. He wavered, then said:</p>

<p>"No, that won't do. I must see Ian about this. He
knows. He is wise. I will see Ian this very minute."</p>

<p>Wrapping the money in a piece of old newspaper and
carefully placing it in an inner pocket, he set out. He
went straight to the dingy office in a side alley of the foreign
section of the town, where through the dusty window could
be seen the grizzled head of Ian Skeemersky, the real
estate agent and private banker, whose sign, written by
his own hand, hung over the entrance.</p>

<p>After greetings had been exchanged, he anxiously put the
case before his shrewd friend, whose eyes sparkled with
eagerness as he replied smoothly.</p>

<p>"Nothing so easy and so safe in the world, my dear
fellow. Put your money in my bank. You will get good
interest and can withdraw it whenever you want it."</p>

<p>Stefan hesitated for a second. So much was at stake!
His slow mind must have time to weigh the proposal. As
he noted the earnestness and assurance of Skeemersky's
face, belief in this shrewd friend decided. He drew out the
pack and laid it on the desk before Skeemersky, whose long
fingers closed over it at once.</p>

<p>"You have done well, Stefan Broda, your money is as
safe with me as if it was in Mt. Vavel," he declared.</p>

<p>Stefan felt that he had done well. The phrase "as safe
as Mt. Vavel" lingered in his mind. It helped him be
patient in the long weeks in the factory where he worked
during the winter; it consoled him during the dull days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
while he waited for the open springtime when he planned
to send for Agatha. When he heard of others losing their
small savings in various ways he congratulated himself on
the security of his own, "as safe as Vavel," he would repeat.</p>

<p>One sunny morning in March, just as he decided to stop
on his way from work to withdraw the three hundred dollars
for Agatha's expenses, there came to him a neighbor, in
great excitement. Peter's face was red, his eyes startling
and his voice hoarse.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that robber, that scoundrel!" he stuttered.
"That Skeemersky. He has gone, gone, do you hear?
He has taken it all, all the money in his cursed bank."</p>

<p>Stefan could not believe his ears. Skeemersky gone, and
the money, too! "As safe as Vavel!" he had said. He
stared for a moment and then broke out, weeping for the
first time since his mother's death, cursing the smooth
trickster with hearty Polish curses.</p>

<p>"May the thunder-bolt strike him!" he cried. "I will
lay hands on him. I will choke that money out of his
black soul. Come, we will go!"</p>

<p>They rushed out, boiling with rage, only to find a crowd
of other dupes before the shabby little office in the side-alley.
The tightly closed door and the blank windows
told the story more clearly than any words. Skeemersky
had gone&mdash;the bank was no more!</p>

<p>Despair took strong hold of Stefan. For two days he
roamed the streets, not eating nor drinking, sleepless. He
saw no further, no hope&mdash;all was blackness and desolation.
When he came back to the boarding house on the third
day he found a letter from Agatha. He read it with tears
and intolerable anguish and he passionately kissed the
final sentence: "Every bit of me is yours and I shall never
change." This tender faith was balm to his anguish.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>He put the letter in a pocket nearest his heart, while a
new look came to his tired face. Almost unconsciously
he began to build a new future on the ruins of the old.</p>

<p>He swiftly mapped out his course. The season for farmwork
was at hand. He would go back to the open skies
and broad fields of God's world. He packed a few belongings
in the rusty brown-paper suitcase and boarded the
trolley for the long ride. He knew what he should do if
he could rent a suitable piece of land.</p>

<p>He had spent the previous summer on a farm in the
onion-growing section of the Connecticut Valley; he knew
what large profits might be gotten with hard labor from a
comparatively small plot of ground. He figured that three
or four acres would give him the needed amount in the
fall, if he had health and good weather.</p>

<p>He found the man whom he sought, secured the land, and
went to work. All that season he slaved early and late,
weeding on his knees in the damp earth the interminable
rows of tiny, delicate plants where the weeds sprang like
magic. He heeded neither scorching sun, nor soaking rain.
He cared nothing for the monotony of the toil. Always he
saw before him the steamer that should bring Agatha,
from the hazards of war, to him and security.</p>

<p>By September he had once again the dream within his
grasp. He was back in the old room in the crowded boarding
house, and in his bluish tin trunk at the foot of the bed
were hidden five hundred and fifteen dollars in crisp, clean
notes. His earliest belief in his trunk had come back a
hundredfold. He would not trust any bank, private or
national, with the fruit of his heart-breaking toil. Banking
systems and government investments were all beyond his
grasp. Skeemersky had taught him to distrust others&mdash;the
little thin trunk would not run away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>This conviction of safety obsessed him. He preached it
to others, to his fellow-boarders, especially to the friendly
young man in the room across the hall. "See," he would
say, waving a hand toward the great untrustworthy world
of finance beyond his little window. "They run away&mdash;those
bankers. I have a better place."</p>

<p>He did not tell the friendly young man where or how
much he had hidden. He merely smiled mysteriously.
His faith in his trunk was absolute. Day after day, when
returning from work in the factory, he took out his roll
of notes and rejoiced that he had found the solution; he
counted the days when he should send for his love. It
was hard for him to wait for the lagging spring, but a winter
journey in war-time from Russian Poland to New England
was not to be thought of for his Agatha.</p>

<p>Blind faith often leads to the pit. Stefan, upon a night
in late winter, found his theory shattered. The friendly
young man had gone, and the crisp, clean notes had disappeared
with him!</p>

<p>In this second crash of his hopes he was numbed. He
neither wept nor cursed. He silently shrank into himself.
He grew abstracted. He stared at the world with unseeing
eyes. In the turmoil of his distracted mind there was but
one growing determination not to be beaten by fate.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until the news of the German campaign
in Warsaw, that his resolve took definite shape.
Borrowing two hundred dollars, he sent the money to
Agatha in Poland, and regardless of winter or war, urged
her to come at once.</p>

<p>When, after long weeks of suspense, he stood by the gate
at Ellis Island waiting for the sight of her dear, familiar
face among the surging crowd of tagged and numbered
immigrants beyond the iron barrier, a great wave of joyous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
hope flooded his heart. All his disasters were forgotten
when he caught the glint of her pale hair under the embroidered
kerchief. Banks and trunks went to oblivion
as he took her small roughened hands in his own.
Destiny had no terrors for him.</p>

<p>On the train he poured out his heart to her. He told
her of his great efforts and his greater misfortunes. He
made her see his challenge to destiny. He pictured his
emotions in the last weeks. And he wound up with an
eager entreaty for immediate marriage.</p>

<p>"Let us no longer delay," he urged. "Let us find the
good priest." But Agatha was not to be hurried. Her
blue eyes showed her own sorrow for the words her lips
spoke. "Our love, my Stefan, will not change. But your
money is gone. We cannot live without money. I shall
work, and you shall work. Then we will marry."</p>

<p>Stefan protested vigorously, but he knew that she was
right. He saw that he must yield. He proposed a compromise.
"Let us work then for this spring and summer&mdash;you
in the silk mill and I in my onion patch," he said,
"and marry in the fall. I can wait no longer than that."</p>

<p>Agatha could find no fault with this. It won her approval
of both heart and her reason. Slipping her hand
in his, she nestled closer and they began their hopeful
planning, while the train sped on, bearing them to the
peaceful valley of their future labors.</p>

<p>All the plans&mdash;sensible and practical&mdash;they made that
wonderful first day, were marvelously realized, not by
mere happy chance, but through a great steadfastness of
purpose and unfaltering toil. By thrift and frugality, by
self-denial and sacrifice, they accomplished the miracle.
And they were happy in the doing of it, because they
worked together. Neither Stefan nor Agatha had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
labored so willingly. The radiance of a united future
lighted the way&mdash;always just ahead they saw the hearth-fire
gleaming.</p>

<p>The spring and summer passed swiftly. Stefan and
Agatha learned of America's entry into the world war with
anxious hearts. They dreaded the quenching of that
hearth-fire. But their fears were groundless. Instead of
depreciation and loss the war brought added prosperity.
The wages in the silk mill were raised. Stefan's onion
sets sold at double prices. At the end of the season they
found that they had exceeded their hopes, in spite of paying
off the debt and the increased cost of living.</p>

<p>At last, as Stefan had said, the way was clear. The
crown of their hopes, the wedding day, was set and their
friends invited. A stone house with a little ground had
been secured. The furniture was installed. Everything
was ready for the marriage feast on the next day.</p>

<p>As they left the cozy little house in the long shadows of
the September sunset, Stefan turned at the gate to look
back. His dream was realized. Destiny had not taken
up his challenge so far, and he determined to make the
future sure. Unconsciously his hand stole to the inner
pocket where a modest roll of notes&mdash;the remains of their
combined savings lay warm and safe. In all their anxious
discussions, he and Agatha had not been able to find a
place safe enough to satisfy their fears. Bankers and
trunks had betrayed their trust. Stefan sighed. He had
hoped to have this matter off his mind before the happy
morrow. He wished Agatha would offer some solution
and he turned to her with the old question on his lips.
But he did not ask it. Another voice took up the story.</p>

<p>It was old Shelton, the farmer for whom Stefan had
worked the first summer in the valley. His small eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
were twinkling and his long chin beard wagged importantly.
"Hello, Steve, how'r ye? Settin' up in fine style,
I see. Must be gittin' rich these days."</p>

<p>Stefan thought at first that the shrewd old fellow's
chuckle of delight was a tribute to his and Agatha's achievement.
But he was soon enlightened as to its real source.
Old Shelton bestowed hearty praise on the little house and
neat garden, he congratulated him in advance for the
morrow, but his small eyes fairly snapped as he added,
tapping his own pocket.</p>

<p>"Ye'v spent a pile of money on all this there, and I
s'pose you ain't got much left&mdash;I got somepin here that
'ud interest ye."</p>

<p>It was the answer to Stefan's unuttered question. He
started as old Shelton pulled out from his pocket two
yellowish, stiff folders with much black lettering upon them,
which, when opened by Shelton's toil-worn fingers, disclosed
a number of large square stamps pasted on the
printed squares. Agatha, woman-like, was quick to inquire.
Old Shelton explained with zest.</p>

<p>He showed them first the Thrift card with its green
twenty-five cent stamps. "I got them at odd times, at
the post office," he told them with his exultant chuckle.
"These here," showing the Savings Certificates with blue
five-dollar stamps, "I bought right out when I saw what
a sure thing it was. Safe as Uncle Sam's Capitol at Washington.
Can't never bust up, these can't. No, siree!
Long as this here country holds out, these here stamps are
worth the coin! And look at the money ye make on 'em."</p>

<p>And he explained the process by which today's purchaser
of a blue stamp would be the possessor of a five-dollar note
when the stamps matured at the end of five years. "Only
four-nineteen, ye see," he pointed with a horny finger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"Only four-nineteen today, but five good round dollars in
five years. Ye can't beat that, I tell ye. Not to be safe
and sound, ye understand."</p>

<p>Stefan and Agatha looked at each other. They knew old
Shelton to be the shrewdest, most cautious man in the
community. In a moment they knew what they should do
with the modest roll of bills. The safe place had been
found. The United States Treasury was the only spot.</p>

<p>"As safe as Vavel!" murmured Stefan as the old farmer
after repeated congratulations and chuckled approval of the
young people's eager acceptance of his gospel of thrift,
disappeared down the long road.</p>

<p>"As safe as Vavel," he repeated, and a great surge of
joyful relief flooded his very soul.</p>

<p>He put his arm about Agatha and they turned their
faces toward the sunset glow. In the dim glory of the
skies they saw the steadfast gleam of their own dear hearth-fire.</p>

<p>"The good God has shown us the way," they said.</p>

<h2><a name="UNPATRIOTIC_CARELESSNESS" id="UNPATRIOTIC_CARELESSNESS">UNPATRIOTIC CARELESSNESS</a></h2>


<p>Are you careless? That makes you stop and think a
bit, doesn't it? If you are honest with yourself, the answer
probably will be "<i>Yes</i>," for almost everybody in this
country is careless. That is the principal reason why we
have so many fires.</p>

<p>Here are some figures that should open our eyes.
In 1913, the year before the outbreak of the war, the average
fire-loss for each man, woman and child in France was
49 cents; in England it was 33 cents; in Germany, 28
cents; in Austria, 25 cents; in Italy, 25 cents; in Switzerland,
15 cents; and in Holland, only 11 cents. In the United
States for the same year the direct loss was $2.10&mdash;and
the indirect loss was far higher. Our record was, therefore,
more than four times as bad as that of France, and
nearly twenty times as bad as that of Holland.</p>

<p>Vienna and Chicago are cities of about the same size.
Vienna had fire losses for the year 1913 of $303,200;
Chicago's were $5,513,237, or more than eighteen times as
great. New York City's fire losses were about four and
one-half times as large as those of London. A similar
comparison might be made with many other cities. Can
we be proud of such figures?</p>

<p>Of course there are more wooden buildings in America
than in Europe. This is a condition which will take many
years to change. But the most serious cause of fires could
be removed at once, if all the people would assist; this
cause is found in one word&mdash;<i>carelessness</i>.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the United States, with all
its advantages, is a nation of careless people. Carelessness
is not a thing to be proud of; it is a great national sin.
It shows itself in many habits of recklessness, wastefulness,
and untidiness. It burns our towns; it leads people to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
risk their lives at railroad crossings and other places of
danger; it takes chances with health; it is shown in all
dirty streets, littered back yards, and untidy homes.
It has been well described by Roy K. Moulton, a writer
in the "<i>News</i>" of Grand Rapids, Michigan, as follows:</p>


<p class="center"><i>WHO AM I?</i></p>

<p>I am more powerful than the combined armies of the world.</p>

<p>I am more deadly than bullets, and I have wrecked
more homes than the mightiest of siege guns.</p>

<p>I steal in the United States alone over $300,000,000 each
year.</p>

<p>I spare no one, and find my victims among the rich and
poor alike, the young and old, the strong and the weak;
widows and orphans know me.</p>

<p>I massacre thousands upon thousands of wage-earners
in a year.</p>

<p>I lurk in unseen places, and do most of my work silently.
You are warned against me, but you heed not.</p>

<p>I am relentless. I am everywhere; in the home, on the
street, in the factory, at railroad crossings, and on the sea.</p>

<p>I bring sickness, degradation and death, and yet few
seek to avoid me.</p>

<p>I destroy, crush and maim; I give nothing, but take all.</p>

<p>I am your worst enemy.</p>

<p>I AM CARELESSNESS.</p>

<p>If a foreign army should land upon our shores, it could
not wreak more destruction than this. If such an army
should come and any American were found to be giving
it aid, he would be called a traitor to his country. Every
patriot would rise against such a foe.</p>

<p>The spirit of carelessness in the United States is really
a greater enemy than any foreign invader, and it is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in millions of little unconscious acts of carelessness.
Whenever you, yourself, commit such an act, therefore,
you really range yourself as an enemy of your country, but
if you begin earnestly to watch your actions and to form
new habits of carefulness, you will be helping our great
nation to become safer, healthier, happier, and more useful
to humanity. This is the spirit of true patriotism.</p>

<p>If, then, you are determined to try with all your might
to form these new habits of carefulness, the first great step
toward preventing fire will have been taken.</p>

<p>The sun was just setting, and its last rays gilded the
roofs and towers of the City of Bagdad, on the river Tigris;
and far away, also, on the ripples of the river fell
the evening light, and the numerous boats and ships which
moved about on the surface of the water seemed to plough
through melted gold. On the railing of a high bridge
which led over the Tigris leaned a young man, who now
turned his face towards the sparkling water, now towards
the people passing over the bridge. His attention, however,
appeared to be given less to the inhabitants of the
city than to those who might be taken for strangers through
their appearance and behavior. The eyes of many a passer-by
were turned also upon him, and it seemed many times
as if one or another of them wished to approach him. But
a stern, repelling glance from the young man had the effect,
each time of making them go on their way after a slight
hesitation, shaking the head.</p>

<p>Suddenly two men drew near. The first of them seemed,
judging from his clothing, to be a rich business man from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the city of Mussal; the second, who followed him at some
distance, was apparently his servant. When the man
waiting upon the bridge saw them come up to him, he
straightened up and went to meet them. Greeting respectfully
the man who was apparently a merchant, he said:
"Sir, if, as I assume, you are a stranger in this city, I beg
you to come home with me and sleep in my house."</p>

<p>As the stranger seemed rather taken by surprise, he continued:
"I am called 'Queer Abu Hassan', and live in my
own house. I have made it my duty for some time to take
a stranger home with me every evening as my guest, and
entertain him there as well as I can until the following
morning. You would do me a great honor if you would
accept my invitation."</p>

<p>The stranger was no one else than the Caliph Harun
Alrashid, who was thus caught on one of his favorite wanderings
through the city accompanied by one of his slaves.</p>

<p>After a few kindly words he agreed, called his servant
to him, and both joined Abu Hassan, who soon brought
them to his house not far away. Here he bade them lie
down and make themselves at home. Soon a servant appeared
and brought their supper. It consisted of several
well prepared dishes, and seemed to please both strangers
very well. All kinds of fruit were placed upon the table
for dessert, and after the meal was finished they had a
lively conversation, in which Abu Hassan's mother took
part when she came in to greet the guests. Although neither
she nor her son had any idea of the lofty position of
their guest, they bustled around him so pleasantly and
kindly that Harun stretched himself out comfortably on
a divan and took his share in the talk with real enjoyment.
At last the Caliph requested Abu Hassan to tell him his
history. And so the host of the evening began as follows:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am the son of a very rich merchant, who died only
too young, and I had a good education as a boy. But if
my father made any mistake at that time, it was that he
gave me very little money, and so prevented my learning
how to spend more wisely, which must really be learned
in order to be done properly. So, after his death, I devoted
myself to this occupation with a number of other
young fellows, and enjoyed myself at such a rate that I
soon had got rid of a great part of my property. Fortunately
I saw soon enough the abyss into which my way of
living must lead me. For this reason I drew back, but
first decided to test my friends and see whether they were
true or not. I told them that I had gone through all my
money, and asked them to help me. Not one of them gave
me a reassuring answer. Furthermore, they avoided me,
and acted on the street as if they had never known me.
This contemptible behavior hurt me so deeply, that I came
near to hating the whole human race. But after I had
lived a long time in melancholy loneliness, I pulled myself
together again, and decided to go out among people once
more. I promised myself, however, never again to invite
a friend, but only strangers, and never to keep one longer
than one night in my house, and if I ever saw them again
to act as if I had never seen them. So this evening, just
before I saw you, I turned away from several persons who
had been my guests before, and who were about to speak
to me."</p>

<p>The Caliph laughed, and said: "No one can blame you
under such circumstances, and because of your extraordinary
experience."</p>

<p>After Abu Hassan's mother had retired the young man
brought out a bottle of his best wine, and presented a glass
of it to the Caliph, after first politely tasting it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Caliph drank to him, and asked Abu if he could not do
him a favor in return for his kind hospitality. But Abu
answered with a smile: "You understand, sir, that I do
not count upon recognition, and to-morrow morning will
not know you any more."</p>

<p>"That's so," laughed Harun; "but I had forgotten it.
You can, however, pay no further attention to me if you
wish, and yet if it is distasteful to you to ask a favor for
yourself, request a helping hand to be given to somebody
else."</p>

<p>"Sir," cried Abu Hassan, "my friends were not of the
quality that I would want to do anything for them, nor
will I harm them, either. So I would not know what wish
I could make. But wait!" he broke out suddenly. "There
is one wish which I have often thought of and will tell you
of, although you cannot fulfil it, and perhaps will find it
extremely ridiculous. But you will at least understand
why people call me 'Queer Abu Hassan'."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it," said the Caliph.</p>

<p>Abu Hassan sighed, and announced: "Just for one day
I would like to be Caliph."</p>

<p>"And what influences you to this wish?" asked Harun.
"Would you carry out some important law in the State?
Or look out for yourself immediately?"</p>

<p>"Neither one nor the other," answered Queer Abu Hassan.
"I would just like to have some scamps among my
neighbors thoroughly beaten."</p>

<p>"And you would like to be caliph merely for this purpose?"
laughed Harun Alrashid.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," replied Abu Hassan, "because I cannot
get a suitable punishment measured out to them in any
other way. Since they are rascals, they would easily get
away from the judge to whom I might denounce them."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked the Caliph.</p>

<p>"They would the more surely avoid punishment," said
Abu Hassan, "because their ringleader is a holy Imam of
respected appearance, whom the judge would never believe
capable of any wrong action, and yet they slander
all the respectable people in this quarter of the city, and
try by using every means to gain an influence over the
consciences of the Faithful, while they themselves pay but
scant attention to the laws of the Koran."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Caliph, as he tried to calm Abu Hassan,
who had worked himself up to a rage, "perhaps your
wish to see these scoundrels properly punished will come
true in some way, even if you are not the Commander of
the Faithful. Let us drink to the realization of your wish."</p>

<p>The Caliph seized the bottle and filled the glasses full,
at the same time dropping a pinch of white powder into
Abu Hassan's glass without his noticing it.</p>

<p>Hardly had they drank it off before Abu Hassan nodded
his head and fell into a deep sleep. The Caliph immediately
called his slave, and ordered him to take the sleeping
man on his shoulders and bear him to the palace. Then
he left Abu Hassan's house, pulling the door to, but not
shutting it.</p>

<p>Once arrived at his palace, Harun Alrashid ordered Abu
Hassan to be clothed in a splendid night robe and laid in
the Caliph's own costly bed. Then the officers, servants,
slaves, and slave women received the strictest orders to
carry out Abu Hassan's commissions faithfully next morning,
and, above all, to treat him as if he were the Commander
of the Faithful.</p>

<p>You can imagine Abu Hassan's astonishment when he
woke up next morning in the splendid bed and looked
around at the room so beautifully decorated with gold and
expensive wall hangings. At first he thought he was
dreaming. He kept opening and closing his eyes, trying
to find out for sure if he were asleep or awake. Still greater
was his amazement when he caught sight of a garment of
woven gold near his bed, and a caliph's cap on a silken
cushion. But yet he could not believe that these were all
real things, and he had to convince himself by feeling them
that he was not in a world of dreams.</p>

   <img src="images/illus191.png" alt="Please Bite My Finger" title="Please Bite My Finger" />
</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">"Please Bite My Finger"</span></p>

<p>"Where am I, then?" he cried. "What has happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to me? Everything looks as if I were in the Caliph's palace.
Or have I become Caliph myself over night?"</p>

<p>While scolding himself for his foolish thoughts, he was
trying all the time to go to sleep again. But suddenly
the lofty double doors of his chamber opened, and a troop
of wonderfully beautiful women and black slaves stepped
in. One band of women began to sing and play charming
music on different instruments. The others threw themselves
down before him, and one of the black slaves stepped
to the bedside and said: "Commander of the Faithful, it
is time for early prayers. May it please you to get up?"</p>

<p>"Whether I'm Caliph or not, I will get up at least just to
see how this adventure turns out!"</p>

<p>Hardly did he show his intention of raising himself when
the slaves jumped in a hurry to help him, and to dress him
in the golden morning gown. At the same time all those
present shouted: "Commander of the Faithful, God give
you a blessed day!"</p>

<p>Now, this was too much for poor Abu Hassan. He called
one of the women to him, and said: "Please bite my
finger, so I can see if I am dreaming or not."</p>

<p>The slave that he called knew that Harun Alrashid was
watching everything from the next room, and wished to
amuse the real Commander of the Faithful. So she bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Abu Hassan's finger sharply. The quickness with which
Abu Hassan pulled back his finger made the hidden Caliph
almost split his sides with laughing, and he congratulated
himself that he had found such an enjoyable diversion by
carrying his plan through. He said to himself: "Abu
Hassan could hardly be more curious than I am to know
how the story will end."</p>

<p>But Abu Hassan was thinking: "I cannot understand
this surprising change, but it seems to me that the queer
Hassan of yesterday has become the real Caliph of today."
So he let them put his clothes on him without resistance,
and with a certain dignified manner which the
Caliph noticed with great pleasure. Then they washed his
head, face and hands with deliciously scented water. Finally
the Grand Vizier announced, with many a bow of
respect, that the great people of the court and of the realm
were assembled and expecting the appearance of the Commander
of the Faithful. So Abu Hassan drew himself up
to his full height, and, preceded by armed soldiers and a
number of chamberlains resplendent in gold, walked to the
great throne room, where he was led to the throne by the
chamberlains.</p>

<p>The doors of the hall opened, and the Commanders-in-Chief
of the Army, the Governors of the Provinces and
the nobles of the country marched in in a wonderful parade
and greeted Abu Hassan as Caliph. They stepped forward
to the throne, dropped on their knees, and touched
the carpet before him with their foreheads. Abu Hassan
took all of this as quietly as if he had been Caliph since
youth. He listened to the Grand Vizier's address, took
part in the consultations over matters of state, and decided
difficult points with such a sound understanding of human
nature that the real Caliph, who stood disguised among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
officers, was greatly pleased. Suddenly Abu Hassan made
a sign to the Grand Vizier to interrupt his address.</p>

<p>"Where is the Chief of Police of our capital city?" he
cried. "Let him be brought here immediately."</p>

<p>When the man called for had appeared and announced
himself, "at the command of his mighty master," Abu said:
"In the mosque of the new quarter you will find an Imam
and four other old men. I wish you to arrest them and
give each one hundred stripes with the bastinado. Then
let them be mounted backwards on camels and led through
the city accompanied by a herald, who shall call out these
words: 'In this way the Commander of the Faithful punishes
those who meddle in matters that do not concern
them, and who know nothing better to do than bring trouble
and pain to their neighbors.' After this sentence is
completed, however, you are then to tell them that they
must leave that quarter of the city, and not set foot in it
again under penalty of death."</p>

<p>While the magistrate hurried away to carry out Abu
Hassan's command, the Grand Vizier went on with his
address. An hour later the Chief of Police came back with
the news that the Caliph's orders had been conscientiously
fulfilled, at which Abu Hassan felt the greatest satisfaction,
while Harun Alrashid thoroughly enjoyed seeing his
substitute arrive so quickly at the realization of his long
cherished wish.</p>

<p>After the business matters were finished, there took place
another stately reception of numerous foreign ambassadors,
and finally the new Caliph betook himself with his whole
court to dinner. It consisted of a selection of the most
delicate food and wine, and lasted late into the evening, with
music and all kinds of dancing.</p>

<p>Abu Hassan had behaved in such a dignified manner for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
all this time that now he showed every favor to the people
in his neighborhood, and even condescended to talk with
the slaves. It was fairly late when one of the most beautiful
of the slave girls came up to Abu Hassan and offered
him a glass of the sweetest wine prepared especially for
the Caliph. Abu Hassan was charmed, and had not any
suspicion that the delicious mixture contained a potent
sleeping powder. He drank it off, and in a few minutes
fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>As quickly as he was brought away the day before, just
so speedily now was he transported into his own dwelling.
Next morning the Caliph for One Day woke up again as
Abu Hassan, and found himself in his old circumstances.
In spite of all his calls and shouts, neither the slaves nor
the court officers of yesterday hurried to him to ask his
wishes. He was sadly perplexed at first at this new change,
but he soon got over it, and consoled himself with thinking
that at least he had had a beautiful dream. When his
mother told him that he had in fact disappeared for a
whole day, and when he also learned that the Imam and
his fellows had been punished exactly as he had ordered
when Caliph, he did not know what to think of the whole
adventure at all.</p>

<p>Finally, he leaned to his mother's view, who explained
it by saying that some spirit had taken him away and had
executed the Imam's punishment. He was thankful indeed
to be rid of his rascally neighbors, but he could never give
himself an explanation of what had moved the spirit to
help him. In the end, however, he put the whole story out
of his mind, and became again what he had been before&mdash;Queer
Abu Hassan, or the Caliph for One Day.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FIRST_POTTER" id="THE_FIRST_POTTER">THE FIRST POTTER</a></h2>


<p>Ang was a mighty hunter and also a priest of Odin, but
Oma was a famous housewife or cave-wife, and not only
Suta, the wife of Wang, came to take lessons of her, but
many other women who had heard of her wonderful skill
in cooking old food in new ways and discovering new foods
which the magic of the fire made palatable. She had
learned not merely how to cook the meat which Ang
brought, but to dry it so that it would keep for a long
time. She discovered how to make a coarse flour from nuts
and acorns and to bake cakes on flat stones. At the fire
feast the cooking of Oma made as great an impression as
the wisdom and strength of Ang.</p>

<p>But her greatest discovery was the art of making pottery
dishes out of clay and baking them before the fire. For a
long time women had made baskets of reeds and willow
twigs in which they could carry dry foods, but the problem
was to get something in which they could carry liquids.
Sometimes they used skin bottles, but they soon leaked and
the water rotted them out. Then some clever woman
smeared the inside of a closely woven basket with resinous
pitch. Another lined her baskets with clay and baked
them in the sun, but water would soon soften the clay.
Then came Oma and the fire and the art of baking clay.
This is the way it happened. Oma had been lining some
baskets with clay, and little Om tried to imitate her. Since
it was cold he sat as near to the fire as he could, and after
he had finished one, he would put it on a stone near the
fire until he had a row of them. Then the wind changed
suddenly and blew the fire towards him, and he had to
move quickly, leaving his clay baskets on the rock. He
called to his mother to get them, but she had no notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
getting burned for so small a cause and she was too busy
to bother, as mothers often are.</p>

<p>That night after Om had gone to sleep she sat by the fire
with Ang, and her eyes spied the little row of clay baskets.
She picked one up to show the father what a clever boy his
son was getting to be. As she touched the clay, she found
it dry and hard as no clay she had ever touched before.
Some of the baskets were dry and crumbly, but two or three
in the center were hard as stone. A thought came to her.
She ran to the brook and filled the hardest with water and
brought them back to the fire. They did not soften or
leak. Then she put them on a flat stone and pushed them
almost into the fire. Soon the water in them began to
bubble and steam.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Oma. "At the touch of the Red One a
little Cloud Spirit goes up to the great Cloud Spirits that
fly in the blue above us."</p>

<p>Then Ang knew that Odin had given a new gift. "This
time the Red One has spoken to you; what has he said?"</p>

<p>Oma carefully drew the little clay pots from the fire, and
after they had cooled she examined them. Two of them
were cracked, but one was firm and solid as if it had been
cut from stone. She held it up before Ang in triumph.
"This is what we have been waiting for since the beginning
of time. The Red One has worked magic on the clay, and
its old enemy, the water, cannot eat through it."</p>

<p>The next day Oma made baskets lined with clay, and then,
putting them on flat stones, pushed them into the heat of
the fire. Some of them crumbled, but others baked hard
and firm. As the heat burned off the inclosing basket,
the pattern was left molded on the clay.</p>

<p>After many experiments Oma learned just what clay to
use and how to bake it. And she made pots of all sizes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
arranged them on ledges of her cave and filled them with
nuts and seeds. Then she learned how to use the clay pots
for cooking. In the old days she had placed scraps of meat
and bone and roots in a pitch-lined basket and then added
water and hot stones from the fire. Of course the pitch
softened and gave an unpleasant taste to the stew, and
often the hot water softened it so much that the basket
became like a sieve. But now Oma could mix her stews
and brews and boil them until they were soft and delicious,
and the clay dish was just as good as before.</p>

<p>And Suta and other women came to look; and they
wondered and tasted, and smacked their lips, and asked
how it was done, then went home to do likewise. And the
fame of Ang and Oma grew in the north land, and men
said, "They are loved by the Great One".</p>

<p>But if Oma made the first pottery and the most useful,
Suta, wife of Wang, made the most beautiful. After she
had learned to bake the clay so that neither fire nor water
would harm it, she amused herself by making dishes of
queer shapes. Then she discovered it was not necessary
to make the basket molds, and that if she made marks on
the clay they would be baked in. She began by making a
little row of nail prints about the rim&mdash;((((((((((. Then
she made rough pictures of animals and men with a sharpened
stick. And the fame of Suta went out also through
the north land, and they came from far away to see the
wonderful things which she had done. Others tried, but no
one could make such beautiful dishes as Suta.</p>

<p>Before the great fire feast an idea came to Suta like a
dream in the night, she knew not from where. She would
make a great bowl for Odin and she would mold on it
pictures of his gifts, so that all who saw would remember
from whom the good things came. With great care she
shaped a bowl as high as a five-year-old child and so large
that a grown man could not circle it with his arms. On
it she pictured the man who shot the first deer with a stone-tipped
arrow, the man who made the first snare for the
wild birds, the man who first crossed the deep water in a
hollowed log, Ang striking fire from the flints, Oma baking
the clay dishes. Then she hesitated. These and many
things more the Great One had given; what would He give
next? What did she want most?</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus199.png" alt="The First Potter" title="The First Potter" />
</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The First Potter</span></p>

<p>Now Suta was not like Ang or Wang or even like Oma.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Wang had thought sometimes that she was not so good a
cook as Oma, and that she spent too much time listening
to the song of the birds and watching the play of the light
on the water and the woods and the far-off hills. She did
these things sometimes when he thought she ought to get
wood for the fire or cook something for him, and he
grumbled a little. But now that she made dishes of clay
which no one else could make and all men said, "What a
fortunate man Wang is to have a woman that can make
such things!" Wang began to be very proud of her. He
even went so far as to get wood for the fire, which he did
not think man's work.</p>

<p>And what did Suta the dreamer want? She did not
want more food or more clothes or a bigger cave; she
wanted the power to mold in clay the things she saw and
loved. So she put on the great bowl for the All-Father a
picture of a woman, with her back turned on the lookers
and a sharpened stick in her hand, just ready to work the
soft clay, but waiting for the power to draw on clay the
picture in her mind. It was the first expression of the
unsatisfied yearning of the artist for beauty and the power
to express it. For Suta was the mother of those who love
the beautiful and long to give it permanent form.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>When the bowl for the Giver was finished, it was placed
on a stone foundation in front of the stone altar, which Ang
and Wang had made. At the feast it was filled with sparkling
water from a spring near by, and as the men danced about the
fire they dipped their hands in it as they passed by and
sprinkled the water on the fire and on themselves and sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Singing water of the brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shining laughter of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking picture of the clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Earth and fire and water, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are voices of the Great.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All who saw the great bowl which Suta had made were
filled with wonder, and they wanted her to make something
for them. Then the great idea came to Wang. Now
Wang was not so strong as Ang or so good a hunter, but he
wanted just as much to eat and just as warm furs to wear.
He liked better to sit talking with some crony in the shade
in summer or by the fire in winter. Talking and sitting
were the two things of which he never tired. Now when
the world was young, such men went hungry and cold, and
Wang had done so often, and, more's the pity, Suta and
little Sut; but then came the idea. Every one wanted
Suta's clay dishes; he wanted deer's meat and bear's, and
furs, and the choicest seeds and nuts. He would barter
the things which Suta made for the things he wanted.
Suta would do the work; others would bring food and
furs and fruits; he would sit in front of the cave and give
as little of the first for as much of the second as possible.
And the idea worked. Suta loved to mold the plastic clay
and decorate it. Many wanted the things which she had
made, and Wang's wily tongue multiplied the number of
those who were willing to pay for what they wanted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>So Wang became the father of a long line of traders, and
the Wang family had more food than they could eat and
more furs than they could wear. Wang grew thick in the
belly and thin in the calf, but it suited him, and Suta was
too busy with her clay to care. And Wang the trader
became almost as great a man as Ang the priest.</p>

<p>And Oma, wife of Ang, grew envious of Suta, wife of
Wang. And she grumbled to Ang: "Did not you find the
Red One and bring Wang and Suta so that they should
not perish from the cold? Have you not fed them with
meat of your own hunting? Did not I learn from the
Red One how to harden and mold the clay? Did I not
show Suta? Do I not work harder than she? Am I not
a better cook? Can I not make better coats of fur? But
see, little Sut has finer furs than Om and is fatter. And
all who come now pass by our cave, except at the great
feasts, or when they are sick and in trouble, and go to
talk with Wang and look at Suta. Is she so much better
to look at than Oma?"</p>

<p>But Ang comforted her with wisdom that had come
from long broodings under the shadow of the Keeper of
Secrets. "The Giver has differing gifts. To the fire he
gives one, to the water another, to the earth another. To
Suta he gave the love of beauty; to you he gave the love
of doing and making; and the joy of doing is greater than
the joy of having. To each her gifts as the Great One
wills. And I would rather be the man of Oma than of
Suta." So Oma was comforted, though she often sighed
wistfully as she saw men and women go by to the cave of
Wang or watched Suta deftly mold some new thought into
the yielding clay.</p>

<p>"That is a terrible affair!" said a Hen; and she said it
in a quarter of the town where the occurrence had not
happened. "That is a terrible affair in the poultry-house.
I cannot sleep alone to-night! It is quite fortunate that
there are many of us on the roost together!" And she told
a tale, at which the feathers of the other birds stood on end,
and the cock's comb fell down flat. It's quite true!</p>

<p>But we will begin at the beginning; and the beginning
begins in a poultry-house in another part of the town. The
sun went down, and the fowls jumped up on their perch to
roost. There was a Hen, with white feathers and short
legs, who laid her right number of eggs, and was a respectable
hen in every way; as she flew up on to the roost she pecked
herself with her beak, and a little feather fell out.</p>

<p>"There it goes!" said she; "the more I peck myself the
handsomer I grow!" And she said it quite merrily, for
she was a joker among the hens, though, as I have said, she
was very respectable; and then she went to sleep.</p>

<p>It was dark all around; hen sat by hen; but the one that
sat next to the merry hen did not sleep: she heard and she
didn't hear, as one should do in this world if one wishes to
live in quiet; but she could not refrain from telling it to her
next neighbor.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what was said here just now? I name no
names; but here is a hen who wants to peck her feathers out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to look well. If I were a cock I should despise her." Then
she too went to sleep.</p>

<p>And just above the hens sat the Owl, with her husband and
her little owlets; the family had sharp ears, and they all
heard every word that the neighboring Hen had spoken,
and they rolled their eyes, and the Mother-Owl clapped her
wings and said:</p>

<p>"Don't listen to it! But I suppose you heard what was
said there? I heard it with my own ears, and one must
hear much before one's ears fall off. There is one among
the fowls who has so completely forgotten what is becoming
conduct in a hen that she pulls out all her feathers, and then
lets the cock see her."</p>

<p>"Prenez garde aux enfants," said the Father-Owl.
"That's not fit for the children to hear."</p>

<p>"I'll tell it to the neighbor owl; she's a very proper owl
to associate with." And she flew away.</p>

<p>"Hoo! hoo! to-whoo!" they both screeched in front of the
neighbor's dovecote to the doves within. "Have you heard
it? Have you heard it? Hoo! hoo! there's a hen who has
pulled out all her feathers for the sake of the cock. She'll
die with cold, if she not dead already."</p>

<p>"Coo! coo! Where, where?" cried the Pigeons.</p>

<p>"In the neighbor's poultry-yard. I've as good as seen
it myself. It's hardly proper to repeat the story, but it's
quite true!"</p>

<p>"Believe it! believe every single word of it!" cooed the
Pigeons, and they cooed down into their own poultry-yard.
"There's a hen, and some say that there are two of them
that have plucked out all their feathers, that they may not
look like the rest, and that they may attract the cock's
attention. That's a bold game, for one may catch cold and
die of a fever, and they are both dead."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wake up! wake up!" crowed the Cock, and he flew up
on the plank; his eyes were still very heavy with sleep, but
yet he crowed. "Three hens have died of an unfortunate
attachment to a cock. They have plucked out all their
feathers. That's a terrible story. I won't keep it to myself;
let it travel farther."</p>

<p>"Let it travel farther!" piped the bats; and the fowls
clucked and the cocks crowed, "Let it go farther! let it go
farther!" And so the story traveled from poultry-yard to
poultry-yard, and at last came back to the place from which
it had gone forth.</p>

<p>"Five fowls," it was told, "have plucked out all their
feathers to show which of them had become thinnest out of
love to the cock; and then they have pecked each other,
and fallen down dead to the shame and disgrace of their
families, and to the great loss of the proprietor."</p>

<p>And the hen who had lost the little loose feather, of
course did not know her own story again; and as she was a
very respectable hen, she said:</p>

<p>"I despise those fowls; but there are many of that sort.
One ought not to hush up such a thing, and I shall do what
I can that the story may get into the papers, and then it
will be spread over all the country, and that will serve those
fowls right, and their families too."</p>

<p>It was put into the newspaper; it was printed; and it's
quite true&mdash;<i>that one little feather may swell till it becomes five
fowls</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_SELLA_LOST_HER_SLIPPERS" id="HOW_SELLA_LOST_HER_SLIPPERS">HOW SELLA LOST HER SLIPPERS</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>You have heard about the early peoples who found out how
to use tools, how to build fires, how to make clothes out of
skins of animals, and how to do all the other everyday things
that once had to be done for the very first time. Science has
found out for us the facts about how all these things were done
first. But in the old days, before there was any knowledge of
science, people had to explain such matters as best they could,
by means of legends, such as that of Prometheus, who, as you
have heard, stole fire from heaven. Here is a legend that
suggests how water was first tamed and made a servant of man.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the days of old, when wonderful things happened,
there lived in a pleasant dwelling beside a brook in the
forest a young girl named Sella, a name which means "a
shadow". Although she was very beautiful, so that everyone
admired her, she did not like to stay very much of the
time with other people. She liked better to gather flowers
on the bank of the stream, or to sit in the shade of a great
rock listening to the sweet murmur of the flowing water.
It was her delight to wander up the stream, tracing to the
source in the mountains each of the little brooks that fed
the larger one. She knew every little spring that stole
forth from under a hanging rock, and every little rill that
came trickling down the bare hillside. Often she rowed
her little boat out on the lake or on the wide river into
which the stream ran.</p>

<p>In the days when Sella lived girls were not taught anything
except the things that it was thought belonged to
woman's place, such as sewing, the keeping of the house,
and the art of making one's self charming and agreeable.
For a girl to go out into the world to make her own way
as girls do now was an unheard-of thing. Girls must stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
at home and leave adventure to the men of the family.
Sella was not at all contented with such an arrangement.
She looked at her two brothers enviously, thinking, "If I
were only a boy, I could follow the river down to the sea
and see all the strange peoples and customs in other parts
of the world. I should like to see what kind of houses they
have, and how they build their stately ships, what kind
of flowers grow in their gardens, and what fruits ripen in
their orchards. Here men make their living by raising
sheep, but there I hear they sprinkle the great plains with
corn, which springs up and ripens and is harvested to give
bread to all the nations. I long to see all these things, and
I would have seen them, long ago, if I were not so unlucky
as to be a girl."</p>

<p>One morning in early spring Sella came to her mother in
breathless excitement. "See, mother dear," she said, "what
I have found on the bank of the stream!" And she showed
a pair of white slippers, spangled and embroidered in silver.
"See, my name is worked on the edge; and just look,
mother, they fit me!"</p>

<p>"To be sure, they are very dainty," said her prudent
mother. "But they do not belong to you. Perhaps some
careless passer-by dropped them there, or perhaps they were
put there as a snare to lead you into harm. I don't like
the look of the letters embroidered on them; they don't
seem to me to spell your name, but rather to look like
magic signs that may work you evil. Nay, daughter, you
must not wear them."</p>

<p>So Sella hung the slippers in the porch, so that anyone
who had lost them could see them as she passed by. No
one claimed them, however. At last, one day in May,
Sella did not appear at the noonday meal. They looked
for her in all her favorite places and shouted her name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
through the woods, but all in vain. At night they went
out with torches still seeking her. All the next day they
searched, climbing high into the mountains. Towards evening
of the second day, when they had given up hope, suddenly
Sella appeared at her mother's side where she sat
alone and sad.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, forgive me," she cried. "I just tried the
slippers on for a moment, and before I could take them off
again I found them carrying me along as if my feet had
wings. At the bank of the stream there waited for me a
lovely creature, with flowing hair and filmy green garments.
She took my hand and led me right into the stream,
and together we went along in the midst of it. Gayly we
leaped the crag and swam the pool and glided between
shady meadow banks. The stream broadened and became
a river, and still we went onward, past stately towns, and
under leaning masts of gallant ships, till at last we reached
the sea and passed below its waves. The seaweed grew on
tall stems like trees, and I could see the coral, the gleaming
fish, and the rosy shells lying on the white sand at the
bottom. Herds of sea creatures went by us, dolphins and
whales and even sharks, but they turned aside to make
room for us."</p>

<p>Bella's mother interrupted her. "This is just a dream,
dear Sella, a vain dream."</p>

<p>"No, mother, for here is what my guide gave me to
prove my story true." And Sella showed a sea-green scarf,
adding, "And she told me to keep the slippers, and that
whenever I put them on I could go down to the bottom of
the ocean again and see all the lovely things. Oh, mother,
it is so beautiful there! But after we had wandered about
a long time I grew weary, and longed for my dear mountain
home. And so she brought me back; and now I will never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
leave your side again." And she flung her arms about her
mother and kissed her, begging forgiveness once again.</p>

<p>Sella kept her promise. But, sadly enough, she did not
have to keep it long, for in less than two years from that
May day her mother died. The little mountain home was
very sad. But after her first grief passed, Sella was very
often absent from the household, and her father and brothers
and older sister knew that she was away in the world of
waters with her friends the water-nymphs. When she was
at home she often sat looking blankly into space, with her
thoughts far away. Her brothers tried to persuade her not
to go away from them so often, but she only looked at them
sorrowfully, and wept, saying never a word in answer to
their pleading.</p>

<p>At last there came a day of merriment and good cheer
in the quiet home. Bella's sister was to be married. The
guests came from hill and valley in all the country round.
Sella welcomed them, beautiful and calm as usual, with her
clear blue eyes, fair hair, and skin as white as the water-lily.
She looked like a water nymph herself, so much of her
time had been spent in her beloved water.</p>

<p>Now it happened that that very morning the older of
her two brothers had been out upon the hillside and had
seen Sella come out from the stream, and had noticed where
she put her slippers in a cleft of rock behind a tree. Now,
under cover of the merriment of the wedding while all the
youths and maidens were dancing, the two brothers stole
away to the spot where the slippers lay hidden, took them
out, followed the brook down a little way to where its current
flowed very rapidly, and dropped them in. The stream
seemed to lift welcoming hands to catch them, and they
slid rapidly out of sight. Then the brothers returned to
the house.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>As evening came near, Sella grew tired of the feasting
and dancing and noise and longed for the quiet that she
could find below the sea. So she ran out to the brook to
get her slippers. They were gone! She searched all along
the brookside, but could not find them. Frightened, she
ran wildly from place to place, and searched in the same
spots over and over. Someone had taken them; and it did
not take her long to think who the someone was. She ran
to the house and charged her brothers with the theft. They
frankly told her all that they had done, saying that it was
because they loved her so. "We could not bear to have
the cold world of waters steal our sister from us. Now
you can never go away from us again."</p>

<p>When Sella heard how the stream had seized and carried
away her precious slippers, she gave a broken-hearted shriek.
"They are gone forever! Oh, how cruel you have been to
me!" And she left them and ran away to her room, locked
her door, and would not let anyone in to comfort her. All
night she wept and mourned, knowing that never again
could she visit the sea caves and meadows where she so
loved to roam, nor talk with the gentle sea-nymphs. All
the next day she wandered alone by the brook, envying its
shining waters which danced along on their way to the sea.
But by the next day she became more used to her loss, and
began to resolve that since it was no use to mourn for what
was gone, she would begin a new life whose days should be
given to quiet tasks of good in the great world. She knew
that she had learned many things about the water that
men everywhere would be glad to know. In patient, loving
service she would forget her loss.</p>

<p>So the years passed. Sella still loved to haunt the
springs and brooks as in her cheerful childhood. She
taught men to know the right places in which to dig wells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
so as to be sure to find water beneath the earth. She
showed them how to build aqueducts by which to bring
the water from the mountain streams to towns far away
from any water. She showed them how to tame the rushing
stream and make its water drive the millwheel. She
bade them build cisterns and pools and reservoirs to catch
the rain-water in the wet season, so that in the dry months
of the year it could be carried in canals into the parched
fields to irrigate them. Everywhere Sella's name was loved
and honored.</p>

<p>Bryant, our first American poet, who has told this story
in lovely verses which you must read some day, speaks of
Sella's age and death in the lines which follow.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Still she kept, as age came on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her stately presence; still her eyes looked forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From under their calm brows as brightly clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the transparent wells by which she sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So oft in childhood. Still she kept her fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwrinkled features, though her locks were white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred times had summer, since her birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened the water-lily on the lakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So old traditions tell, before she died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred cities mourned her.&mdash;&mdash;By the brook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rippling ran beside the cottage door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she was born, they reared her monument.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THE_GHOST_OF_TERRIBLE_TERRY" id="THE_GHOST_OF_TERRIBLE_TERRY">THE GHOST OF TERRIBLE TERRY</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is a real boy story in real boy talk.</p>

<p>It is a first-class story to outline. Read it through&mdash;you
will be so much interested that you can't help reading fast&mdash;then
close the book and make an outline.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am the ghost of Terrible Terry! I have murdered ten
men in cold blood and buried their bones, in the dark of
the moon, on the crest of Death-Rattle Hill! You will
meet me there at dark on the evening of October 30! If
you fail me BEWARE. (Following which was a crudely
drawn skull and cross bones.)</p>

<p>"Gosh!"</p>

<p>That was all George Taylor could say as he read the
letter which his father had just brought home in the evening
mail. The mere thought of Death-Rattle Hill <i>after
dark</i> was enough to make a fellow's heart jump into his
throat, for Death-Rattle Hill had received its name from a
popular superstition that grew out of the murder there, in
pioneer days, of an old trapper.</p>

<p>This trapper, "Dad" Smith, as he was known on the
frontier, was returning to his cabin in the wilderness, after
selling his winter catch of furs, when he was attacked at
dusk by "Terrible Terry", a notorious desperado of the
early days. He was found the next day with more than a
score of knife-wounds in his body.</p>

<p>Legend credited Terry with numerous other ghastly
crimes until at last he met his fate in a manner which remains
a mystery. His body was found in the woods not
far from the spot where Smith was murdered. A rifle ball
had passed through his throat. From then on stories were
circulated concerning peculiar noises that could be heard at
dusk on the hill. These noises, so the tales agreed, resembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a choking, gasping sound&mdash;such as a man might
make in struggling for breath. So it came about that this
hill came to be known throughout all the country as "Death-Rattle
Hill."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" said Taylor once more as these thoughts went
racing through his head. Then he jerked his cap from its
hook in the hall and ran down the alley to see if any other
of the boys had received a similar message.</p>

<p>Carrots Crawford, Pepper Perkins and several other members
of the troop were talking excitedly.</p>

<p>"Hey, George," they called as the scout appeared, "did
you get one, too?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean a letter from Terrible Terry?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing," said Pepper; "all the fellows got them.
It's just another of Mr. James' stunts. Say, Scouts, remember
that party we had at headquarters last Hallowe'en?
Didn't we have a circus! And I'll bet this year we'll have
a bigger time yet!"</p>

<p>After much discussion the group broke, and only Taylor
and Pepper Perkins remained. If the departing scouts had
been thinking less about the queer noises that were supposed
to be heard on Death-Rattle Hill, they might have
observed that these two leading lights of Glenwood troop
had their heads together in earnest consultation.</p>

<p>It was ten days until the last of October; ten days filled
with the greatest anticipation for the members of Glenwood
troop; although every scout in the troop felt a peculiar
sinking feeling at the pit of the stomach at the thought of
Death-Rattle Hill, not one of them would have admitted
it, and not one of them thought of failing to keep his appointment
with "Terrible Terry", especially after the rumor
was spread that each scout should go armed with a fork,
a spoon and a tin cup. The boys agreed among themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that they would meet at troop headquarters and
march in a body to Death-Rattle Hill.</p>

<p>Hallowe'en evening came at last. The members of Glenwood
Troop reported at their headquarters to a man,
quaking inwardly if the truth were known, but prepared
to keep their rendezvous with the ghost of a cut-throat in
the most haunted spot in all the land! Great was their
relief when Mr. James appeared and said he had thought
it best to accompany the boys on such a dangerous undertaking.</p>

<p>They started out, rather more boisterously than usual,
laughing, shouting and singing, but the nearer they got to
Death-Rattle Hill the quieter they became. By the time
they reached the crest of the hill they were huddled together
like sheep.</p>

<p>"Here we are, boys," came the Scoutmaster's cheery
voice at last as the scouts reached a little clearing between
two tall Norway pines. Not far from one of the trees a
huge bonfire had been built. Mr. James struck a match,
the flames ran quickly through the dry sticks and logs, and
in almost no time the clearing was light as day.</p>

<p>With the lighting of the fire, the spell that had been cast
over the boys by thoughts of Terrible Terry was partially
broken, and they entered into the games and stunts that
Mr James had planned for them with their customary
spirit.</p>

<p>With their hands tied behind their backs they tried to
bite apples suspended from the branches of the pine by
long strings and bobbed for apples in a big tub of water.
They had boxing and wrestling bouts, dug pennies with
their teeth out of shallow pans partly filled with flour, held
a war-dance around the fire and yelled as only hungry boys
can yell when Mr. James produced a pail of steaming cocoa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
a big box of "dogs", a pan full of doughnuts, and a box of
red apples.</p>

<p>But in spite of all they could do to forget the stories of
Death-Rattle Hill they could not escape a vague, uneasy
feeling, and many a furtive glance was cast into the surrounding
trees and bushes.</p>

<p>When the last drop of cocoa had disappeared and the
last red apple had followed the "dogs" and doughnuts to
their doom, the boys crawled close to the glowing embers
of the fire and, following their usual custom, begged Mr.
James for a story.</p>

<p>The fire was slowly dying, and the occasional flickering
flames cast fantastic shadows on the hazel bushes and the trees.</p>

<p>"We have all heard more or less about strange sights and
sounds in places where men have met with violent death,"
said Mr. James by way of beginning his yarn. "For instance,
I have been told that in this very clearing there
grows a peculiar red moss which traces in exact outline the
spots on the earth where the old trapper Smith's life-blood
dyed the sod. Hunters have told me that no animals ever
cross this clearing&mdash;that in the dead of winter not even a
rabbit track breaks the smooth expanse of snow which is
marred only by a ghastly crimson stain where poor old
Smith's body was found.</p>

<p>"But let me get on with my story. Thirteen years ago
this very night an old hunchback peddler, who had been
selling his wares in the backwoods settlements, lost his
bearings in the forest and found himself at dusk in this
very clearing. Being completely exhausted from his wanderings,
he decided to make himself as comfortable as possible
for the night. He built a fire in the early evening, and, as
the embers slowly settled into ashes fell into a half sleep
leaning against his pack.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just how long he dozed by the fire he could not tell,
nor could he remember exactly what wakened him, yet
suddenly he was startled into consciousness, every nerve
a-tingle with a sense of impending danger. Some power
he could not sense drew his attention irresistibly to a huge
pine tree&mdash;that one right there!</p>

<p>"With his eyes starting from their sockets he sat incapable
of movement, waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;when suddenly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Out of the pine on which every scout was focusing his
gaze came an unmistakable choking, gasping sound.</p>

<p>An instant later a faintly glowing light appeared.</p>

<p>"Great goodness! Look there!" exclaimed Patrol Leader
Crawford in a husky voice.</p>

<p>With a piercing shriek a horrible apparition floated out
of the branches of the pine. Its white hair was covered
with ghastly clots of red. Its arms waved wildly, moving
the folds of a flowing white garment splotched with blood.</p>

<p>Transfixed with horror, the boys sat frozen in their tracks
as THE THING rushed toward them.</p>

<p>Then there came a huge splash in the bobbing tub behind
them and an unmistakably human voice exclaimed, "Oh,
thunder!" The voice belonged to Pepper Perkins, and the
Scoutmaster's flashlight revealed its owner in a sitting
posture in the tub of water, whence he had fallen from a
low branch of a tree directly over his head.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the "ghost" that had floated out of the pine
was having troubles of its own. It stopped floating with a
sudden jerk and hung suspended in mid-air, with a pair of
khaki legs dangling beneath the flowing garment and kicking
around for something solid to stand on, while a very
unghostly voice pleaded, "Gosh, sakes! Can't you help a
feller down?"</p>

<p>A few turns of the flashlight revealed the whole plot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
The "ghost" had floated on a wire stretched from the huge
pine to the smaller one across the clearing. The faintly
glowing light was a flashlight enclosed in a paper sack, the
horrible head-dress a piece of old fur robe smeared with red
paint, and the "shriek" a siren whistle.</p>

<p>You have heard how Death-Rattle Hill came by its name.
And now you know how it came about that George Taylor
of the Glenwood Scouts acquired the name of "Terry"&mdash;a
name which he bears to this day.</p>

<p>An American private spied a rooster prowling around a
farm house in No Man's Land just after the Americans had
captured Very. Being hungry, and having an appetite
for roast chicken, this American private decided to crawl
up on the rooster and trap him in the building.</p>

<p>The American was about to lay his hands on the astonished
rooster when a German entered the rear door of the
building bent on the same mission. Both were so surprised
that they stood for a moment and glared at each other,
then the American motioned for the German to do a right
flank on the prey they were after and both closed in on him.
The rooster was captured by the American, who later
returned to the American lines with both rooster and German
in tow.</p>

<p>Later, at the regimental P. C., the German roasted the
chicken for his captor, who shared it with him.</p>

<h2><a name="WHY_THE_ECHO_ANSWERS" id="WHY_THE_ECHO_ANSWERS">WHY THE ECHO ANSWERS</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is one of the beautiful Greek myths that everyone is
supposed to know.</p>

<p>Try to read it so carefully in five minutes that you can tell
it from start to finish without being questioned or prompted.
Your teacher will let two or three of you tell the story. Perhaps
some of you can do it well enough to tell it to one of the lower
classes in the school.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the ancient days in Greece, people believed not only
in the great gods and goddesses, such as the god of the sea,
the god of the sun, the goddess of the moon, or the goddess
of the harvest, but also in many less important beings who
took care of smaller things in the world of nature. In
every river lived a god, for whom the stream was named.
The woods were full of fair maidens called nymphs, whom
mortal eyes could not see. They had various names, according
to the particular objects which were their care.
The nymphs who lived each in her own tree were called
<i>dryads</i>; those who dwelt in the springs and brooks were
<i>naiads</i>; while those whose home was in the rocks and hills
were <i>oreads</i>.</p>

<p>Of all the mountain nymphs, or oreads, the most beautiful
was a maiden named Echo. She was one of the troop
of maidens who followed and attended Diana, the goddess
of the woodlands. Echo was very faithful to all her tasks,
devoted to her mistress, and beloved by all her companions.
Her one fault was that, like many another girl, she was too
fond of talking. Her tongue ran all day long. It did not
matter whether or not she had anything important to talk
about; talk she must. The other nymphs were used to it,
and didn't pay much attention; indeed, they hardly listened
to her, a thing which often happens to people who never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
know when to stop talking. But Juno, the queen of the
gods, one day grew so tired of Echo's ceaseless chatter that
she condemned her to lose her power to speak, except to
repeat the words of someone who spoke to her.</p>

<p>This was hard enough when it meant simply that the
maiden could no longer talk to her companions. If you
have ever had so severe a cold that you have lost your
voice for a day or two, you know how many things you
think of that you want to say simply because you are unable
to say them. That was poor Echo's case, only it was
to last forever instead of for a few days. But far worse
than this was to happen to the unfortunate maiden. One
day, not long after she had lost her tongue, as we say, she
saw for the first time the beautiful youth Narcissus, son of
one of the river gods. From that moment Echo's heart
was gone as well as her voice, for she fell in love immediately.
But alas! how could she let him know it? She
could not speak at all, except to mimic his last words whenever
he spoke. And his words did not at all express the
feelings which she wanted to utter. For instance, when
Narcissus, who did not care anything about the lovesick
Echo, and who was anxious to get away, cried to her, "Let
us leave one another," she answered with all her heart,
"One another," and tried to hasten after him. But he
could not or would not understand, and did not wait for
her.</p>

<p>At last Narcissus, who you can readily see was not as
kind as he was beautiful, growing utterly weary of having
the forlorn nymph pursue him, said rudely to her, "I cannot
bear to come near you." "Near you," repeated Echo
with all her heart, ready to fling her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Hands off!" he cried, starting back. "I would rather
die than thou shouldst have me." "Have me," pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the unhappy Echo, but all in vain. The cruel youth would
have nothing to do with her. From that time on she withdrew
herself from the company of the other nymphs, and
wandered alone in hidden caves and among the remotest
cliffs of the mountains. Gradually she faded away till
there was nothing left of her but her voice, which still repeated
the last part of any sound she heard. Sometimes
when you are in the woods or mountains, if you call aloud,
you will hear your own voice seeming to come back to you
like an answer. It is not your voice, you see, but that of
the unfortunate oread; so we call the sound that rings and
rolls along in answer to our voices, by the maiden's name,
Echo.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to know what happened to the
unkind Narcissus. Echo was not the only maiden whom
he scorned. He avoided all the nymphs, for the only person
whom he really loved was himself. As time went on
he loved himself more and more, especially as he saw the
reflection of his own beautiful face in the water. He spent
his days stooping over the deep, still pool that made the
best mirror. He talked to his own image in the still surface;
he tried to embrace it, stooping so far over that he
almost fell in. But the mirrored face made no response to
all his pleadings. He was being well paid for his treatment
of Echo. At last, in despair because his love was not returned,
he pined away and died of a broken heart. Like
other people who love themselves best, he got no happiness
from his vanity and selfishness.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are wondering why the youth whom Echo
loved bore the name of our delicate white spring flower.
It is because that flower first sprang up from the ground on
the spot where the beautiful Narcissus was buried.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FIGHT_WITH_THE_SEA" id="THE_FIGHT_WITH_THE_SEA">THE FIGHT WITH THE SEA</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Before you begin to read this selection, look up the word
<i>reclaim</i>.</p>

<p>This is a good selection for outlining. You can write four or
five topics that will cover the substance of the piece.</p>

<p>Your teacher will keep track of the time it takes each of you
to read the selection and make your outline.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are some learned people who tell us that a great
many years ago the island which we call England, Scotland,
and Wales was one with the continent of Europe. They
say that the sea gradually made its way through a stretch
of low-lying land, till at last Great Britain was completely
cut off from the continent. We all know that the Eastern
counties of England which face the little country of Holland
are just as flat and marshy as the opposite shores. The
farmers and laborers in these countries are continually
endeavoring to make good pasture-land of the unhealthy
marshes and fens, as they are called, and each year sees
acres of land reclaimed and turned to good use; but also
each year a little land is stolen from these counties by the
greedy sea. The patient Dutch people on the other shore
are carrying on the same kind of work. They make wonderful
dykes and drive the sea always a little further and further
back; and though much of their country is actually
beneath the level of the sea, they jealously guard the
treasure they have captured, with so much perseverance
and energy that the tyrant sea is kept in subjection.
Of course, as the land lies lower than the water, the natural
result would be that the water would flood the land unless
it were kept out by an embankment; and this wonderful
little nation, so brave and daring as to defy the sea, have
surrounded their land with dykes, which are huge banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
towering above the lowlands of the country, and preventing
the sea from obtaining entrance. Of course, these dykes
could be made only gradually as the sea was turned from
one spot to another by dams and locks, and these facts
will give you a far better proof than any other I could
find of the wonderful character and the great courage and
perseverance of a nation which has reclaimed its fatherland
from the sea.</p>

<p>You will not be surprised to be told that such a land is
very damp and misty. All the surface is cut up by
innumerable canals. If you could see the whole country
from a height, it would look like an enormous puzzle.
It consists of hundreds of green patches cut up by the waterways,
and decorated with red-roofed villages and towns.
Through all of these canals flows the same water; all of
them are connected with one another. Here and there the
canals are wide, and bear much traffic on their placid
surfaces. Through miles of green fields wander little baby
canals, draining the pasture-lands, and bravely carrying
barges which drift slowly in single file from one busy centre
to another.</p>

<p>There are plenty of railways, but the trains are generally
slow, and in many places the land perceptibly gives way
as the heavy train presses it, so most of the conveyance
is done on the canals.</p>

<p>It is still part of the everyday life of Holland to reclaim
the stretches of mud and marsh from the sea. When this
has been done, the land is first enclosed with a dyke to
prevent any water flowing into it. On the edge of this
dyke wind-mills are erected, each of which works a pump.
You remember how every picture of a Dutch landscape
shows a country dotted with windmills with wide-spreading
arms and sails. As the mills draw up the water, it is discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
into a canal, which takes it to the sea. Only fifty
years ago, an immense piece of submerged land called the
Haarlem Lake was drained and rendered fit for cultivation,
and one of the favorite projects of certain Dutch ministers
is the draining of the Zuyder Zee, an enormous stretch of
water of which you have certainly heard, and which once
must have been dry land.</p>

<p>When I traveled in Holland, one of the greatest discomforts
which I experienced was the want of good drinking
water. The Dutch people are used to it, and drink a good
deal of tea and coffee; but both are taken so strong and
so bitter, that, even if made with the purest water, they
would be undrinkable for you and me. Once, when I was
staying in a tiny village called Volendam, I had taken a
little crying child home to his mother, whom I knew.
She wanted to wash his face which I could hardly see
through dirt and tears, and from where do you think she
drew her water? She lifted a loose board in the floor of her
room, and there, immediately underneath, was a canal
which passed under her house. The house was built on
piles over the water, and the whole family used this dirty
water for everything&mdash;to wash in and to cook with and to
drink. Besides much dirt, there were two or three tiny
fish in the bucket that she took up when I was there, and
when I asked her if she filtered the water at all for drinking,
she shook her head, not understanding the reason for
anything of the kind. So I told her how much better it
would be for her and her family if she boiled the water
before drinking it; but she replied that she thought this
would take away all the taste. Just imagine wanting your
water to taste of dirt and fishes!</p>

<p>Agriculture is the art of cultivating
the soil to produce material for feeding
and clothing the human race. It is
the oldest of all occupations. "The
first farmer," says Emerson, "was the
first man, and all historic nobility
rests on possession and use of the
land." Agriculture is also the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
widely-extended of all occupations,
and it lies at the foundation of all
other industries. Daniel Webster
once said, "When tillage begins, other
arts follow. The farmers, therefore,
are the founders of civilization."
Unless man were fed and clothed the
race would perish.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Illustrating its Importance.</span></p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Adams with their
children, John, aged 14, and Mary,
aged 12, lived in the city. Like many
other city children, John and Mary
knew but little of the country, and
did not seriously consider farming or
anything connected with it. Their
father and mother, however, had
come from the farm, and they decided
to help John and Mary to obtain correct
ideas of the country and of a life
such as they lived in their younger
days.</p>

<p>"John, where did this bread come
from?" asked Mr. Adams, at dinner.</p>

<p>"Why, mother bought it at the
baker's, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Very well, but where did the
baker get it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," said Mary, "he
makes it."</p>

<p>"But what is it made of?" continued
the father.</p>

<p>"There is flour in it," said John,
"and water, and&mdash;and&mdash;lots of other
things."</p>

<p>"A boy never knows anything
about cooking; let me tell," said
Mary. "Bread is made of flour,
water and yeast and&mdash;what else do
they put in it, mother?"</p>

<p>"I don't see as you know much
more about it than I do," said John.</p>

<p>"You children can learn how to
make bread some other time," said
Mr. Adams; "I want to know where
the baker got his flour."</p>

<p>"He bought it of the wholesale
grocer," replied John.</p>

<p>"Well, where did the grocer get
it?"</p>

<p>"That is about as far as I can go,"
said John. "I have often wondered
where all the things we eat come from,
but I have so many things to study
in school that I don't have time to
read about anything more."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the father, "suppose
we make a little study of these
things at dinner. Let us begin with
the bread. What you and Mary have
said is true, but we need to look into
the subject a little further, if we
would know the real source from which
we obtain bread and all other articles
of food. The real source of all these
is the farm, and were it not for the
farmers all the people who live in the
city, as we do, should soon be without
food."</p>

<p>"Why, I never thought of that
before; I never supposed the farmer
amounted to much, anyway," said
John. Mary expressed a similar idea,
and both asked their father to tell
them about those common articles of
food which we all eat without giving
a thought to the source from which
they come or the labor required to
prepare them for our use.</p>

<p>During the next few days Mr.
Adams took the children on a number
of imaginary journeys. With him
they visited in fancy the great wheat
fields of the Dakotas and Canada, the
corn belt in Illinois and Iowa, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
cattle ranches of Texas and Montana,
the fruit orchards of the Pacific states,
the dairy farms and creameries of
Wisconsin, the sugar plantations of
Louisiana, the beet farms of Michigan
and Colorado, and the poultry farms
near some of our great cities. Then
he took them to far-off lands&mdash;to the
coffee plantations of Brazil, the tea
gardens of Formosa, the rice plantations
of China and the spice groves
of India.</p>

<p>Before these imaginary excursions
were ended, John and Mary learned
that everything they ate, except salt,
came from a farm in some part of the
world and that agriculture was carried
on in every country. But Mr.
Adams did not stop here. In the
same delightful way he led the children
to the study of cotton, flax, wool,
and silk, so that they were convinced
that we depend upon the farm for
what we wear as well as for what we
eat. In their minds the farmer at
once became a very important
individual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Progress of Agriculture</span>.&mdash;Agriculture
began when the first man
selected plants for his food. His next
step was to scratch the ground with a
stick and plant seed. Then he took
a forked stick and made a plow of it.
Two or more men hauled this plow
while another held it in position.
But this labor was too hard, so man
tamed the ox and the ass and made
them do the hauling and the carrying
of his burdens, as well. From these
simple beginnings, agriculture has
advanced through the centuries until
to-day traction engines haul over our
great wheat fields gang plows that
turn more than fifty furrows at a
time. Later these same engines haul
over the fields of ripened grain a
machine which at one operation
harvests, thrashes and sacks the
grain ready for market&mdash;does everything,
one humorist says, except to
cash the check for the crop.</p>

<p>Such has been the progress in agriculture
since the middle of the last
century that the labor of producing a
bushel of wheat with the most modern
appliances has been reduced from a
little over three hours to about ten
minutes. Formerly it required four
and one-half hours' labor to produce
a bushel of corn; now it requires less
than forty minutes. Then, it took
thirty-five and one-half hours' labor
to grow a ton of hay; now, it takes
eleven hours and thirty-four minutes.
But this is not all. Production has
been increased many fold; new and
better varieties of grains, vegetables,
fruits and live stock are being constantly
produced; the use of agricultural
machinery has enabled the
farmer to give more attention to the
business side of his affairs, and the
best farms are now operated on a
systematic plan which includes both
the fields and the home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Causes of Progress</span>.&mdash;While the
progress of agriculture may seem to
have been slow, it has advanced
about as rapidly as other arts. The
more rapid advance of recent times
is due chiefly to the following causes:</p>

<p><i>Transportation</i>.&mdash;It is of no advantage
to the farmer to raise crops that
he cannot market; therefore, good
roads form one of the most essential
conditions to his success. Of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the country has far too few, but railways
have become so numerous that
most farms are now within a few
miles of a station if not directly on the
railway itself. Increased facilities for
marketing his crop have greatly
increased the farmers' production.</p>

<p><i>Machinery</i>.&mdash;The machines which
have done most towards the progress
of agriculture are the harvester, or
reaping machine, the gang plow, the
seeder and the horse hoe. What these
have accomplished in reducing the
cost of production is told in the preceding
paragraph. Without these
inventions cultivation of the large
farms in the Prairie states and the
Canadian provinces of the Northwest
would be impossible. Many other
machines have also contributed their
share. Among these are the steam
thrasher, the traction engine, the
gasoline engine, and the cream separator.
Moreover, we must not forget
the improvement in the simpler farm
implements such as the hoe, the
spade, the rake, and the ax, which,
by being made lighter and of better
material than in the long-ago, have
enabled those using them to do more
work with less expenditure of strength.</p>

<p><i>Chemistry</i>.&mdash;The application of
chemistry to soils, plants, and fertilizers
lies at the foundation of scientific
agriculture. The farmer can now
learn from the nearest agricultural
experiment station what fertilizer is
best suited to his soil and what crops
he can grow with greatest success.
Agricultural chemistry is now applied
to the study of soils, of plant food and
of fertilizers wherever there is an
agricultural college.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;Not many years ago
the average farmer was glad to express
his contempt for what he styled
"book farming". Happily, that day
is past, and agricultural education
(see subheading, below) now occupies
an important position in the educational
systems of all civilized countries.
In the United States and
Canada the demand for graduates
from agricultural colleges and high
schools is greater than these institutions
are able to supply. Furthermore,
the outlook for supervisors and
teachers of agriculture is so promising
that young men from the city constitute
no inconsiderable portion of the
student body of these institutions.
This is the beginning of a right sort
of movement from the city to the
country, and it is increasing.</p>

<p><i>Scientific Agriculture</i>.&mdash;All the foregoing
movements have combined to
make agriculture a science as well as
an art. The influence of the agricultural
colleges and experiment stations
extends to the remotest regions,
and everywhere the trained scientist
is helping the farmer to solve his
problems and to make his farm more
profitable. No longer can the old
hit-or-miss methods maintain themselves
in competition with the scientific
methods of the "new agriculture",
which in the near future will
not only render productive vast areas
still barren, but also reclaim the so-called
"worn-out farms" and repopulate
with prosperous families those
which have been abandoned.</p>

<p><i>Prevention of Disease</i>.&mdash;The application
of scientific methods to the
study of those diseases of plants and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
animals which are ever robbing the
farmer of his profits constitutes one
of the most important contributions
of science to agriculture, and is saving
annually millions of dollars to the
farmers. While not all of these diseases
are conquered, many of them
have been; the ravages of others have
been checked, and new victories are
gained each year.</p>

<p><i>Insect Pests</i>.&mdash;What has been said
about the study of disease applies
with equal force to the study of destructive
insects. These pests also
deprive the farmer of a portion of his
income every season, and, now and
then, they destroy his crop altogether.
Through the discoveries made by the
Department of Agriculture at Washington
and in Canada by the same
department of government, and at
the various experiment stations, we
are now able to deal successfully with
these pests on the American continent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Branches</span>.&mdash;Agriculture is so widely
extended over the earth and so
varied in its industries that it is
naturally divided into a number of
branches. While many farmers are
interested in several of these branches,
each gives special attention to one or
two. The farmer in the corn belt,
for instance, makes corn the chief
product of his land, but he must give
enough attention to growing other
crops and to dairying to produce
sufficient food for his family and live
stock, unless he would purchase this
food at an expense considerably
greater than would be required to raise
it. Likewise, the dairy husbandman
must raise most of the feed for his
herd to make his business profitable.</p>

<p>The following are the chief branches
of agriculture in America:</p>

<p><i>Raising Cereals</i>.&mdash;In some regions
the soil and climate are especially
suited to raising cereals. For instance,
Canada, Minnesota and North
Dakota are adapted to raising spring
wheat, and this constitutes their chief
crop. On the other hand, Kansas is
especially suited to raising winter
wheat. Illinois and Iowa are the
great corn states, because of the
particular adaptation of the soil and
climate of the corn belt to the production
of this cereal. The growing of
cereals is more widely extended than
any other branch of agriculture.</p>

<p><i>Other Crops</i>.&mdash;In some of the Northern
states having a cool climate and
in Southern Canada, flax is extensively
grown on new soil. Potatoes
are also successful in these regions.
Oats is an extensive crop throughout
the northern half of the United States
and in most of the Canadian provinces.
In Texas, Georgia, South
Carolina, and a number of the other
Southern states, cotton constitutes
the chief source of revenue. Fodder
crops, including corn for ensilage,
clover, timothy and alfalfa, are also
of great importance in those localities
where live stock is raised or dairying
is the chief line of agricultural industry.</p>

<p><i>Horticulture</i>.&mdash;Horticulture is that
branch of agriculture which includes
the raising of flowers, garden vegetables,
and fruit. The growing of
vegetables and other garden produce
for market is usually called <i>truck
farming</i>, and this branch of horticulture
is very common near large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
cities and in those localities where
soil and climate admit of raising two
or more crops a year. The raising of
fruit is probably the most extensive
branch of horticulture, particularly
in those regions which depend upon
irrigation for their supply of water.
All forms of horticulture are intensified
farming&mdash;that is, the thorough
cultivation of small tracts of land that
is highly fertilized.</p>

<p><i>Live Stock</i>.&mdash;Some localities are
especially adapted to raising live
stock. Iowa and Illinois, for instance
raise large numbers of hogs, which are
fattened on corn. Iowa also raises
beef cattle. Kentucky is noted for
its fine horses; Montana, Wyoming,
and several other states contain
extensive grazing lands where thousands
of sheep find pasturage, and in
Texas beef cattle are raised in large
numbers.</p>

<p><i>Dairy Husbandry</i>.&mdash;Sections of the
country having a cool climate, an
abundance of pure water, and soil
adapted to growing alfalfa and other
ensilage crops are suited to dairying,
and this branch of agriculture is of
great importance in those states.</p>

<p><i>Poultry</i>.&mdash;The proceeds from the
poultry raised in the United States
exceed those received from the wheat
crop; strange as this statement may
seem, the hen is a mighty asset.
Some poultry is found on nearly
every farm, but there are numerous
small farms which are devoted entirely
to raising chickens, and when
rightly managed, they prove a profitable
investment.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_MORGARTEN" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_MORGARTEN">THE BATTLE OF MORGARTEN</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Can you read this selection thoroughly in four minutes?
Some of you can read it in less time than that.</p>

<p>One of the most really democratic countries in the world today
is Switzerland, the little republic among the Alps. It has a
long and glorious history, for it is the earliest of modern republics.
Its sections, instead of being called <i>states</i>, are called
<i>cantons</i>. Switzerland originally belonged to Austria, in the
early days when Austria was ruled not by an emperor but by
a duke. The dukes of Austria were cruel tyrants, and this
story tells how the Swiss mountaineers first began to free themselves
from Austrian rule, in the battle of Morgarten in the
year 1315.</p>

<p>As you read the story, notice:</p>

<p>1. The differences between Swiss and Austrians in numbers
and equipment.</p>

<p>2. What gave the Swiss an advantage over the Austrians.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are people who doubt the story of William Tell
and Gessler, the Swiss archer and the Austrian tyrant;
but no one can doubt the great and decisive victory won
at Morgarten by the Swiss on the 15th of November, 1315.
Three cantons beside the lake&mdash;Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden:
the three Forest Cantons, as they were called,
because of their great woods&mdash;were resolved to be free
of Austrian rule. The Austrian Duke determined to crush
them once and for all.</p>

<p>He regarded it as a very easy matter. He had vast
numbers of horsemen and footmen, all splendidly armed
and well trained in warfare; his opponents were a few
peasants, who clung to their native hills, and loved freedom,
and were ready to die for it. The Austrians looked
upon the affair as a mere hunting excursion. They provided
themselves with cartloads of ropes to lead back
prisoners and the herds of cattle they expected to seize.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>When the men of the forest heard that their enemies
were marching upon them, they gathered to defend their
rights as freemen. They mustered thirteen hundred
fighting men, armed with the rudest of weapons, many
having nothing in their hands save heavy clubs, spiked
with iron. But before night fell those spiked clubs had
been dipped in the best blood of Austria.</p>

<p>Twenty-four thousand of the Duke's finest troops, led
by his brother Leopold, advanced against these shepherds
and herdsmen, and the two armies met on the slopes of
Morgarten. At this point a narrow pass ascends the hill-side;
upon one side of the pass lies the mountain, upon the
other the deep waters of the lake. At the head of the pass
stood the small band of Swiss, calmly surveying the splendid
host of steel-clad knights and men-at-arms which rode
against them. The Austrians pushed up the slope confident
of victory.</p>

<p>But as the latter rode up the pass an avalanche was
loosed upon them&mdash;not an avalanche of snow, but one
prepared by the Swiss themselves. Great stones, rocks,
and trunks of trees had been poised on the edge of the
heights above the pass. When the Austrians were seen
below, these were thrust over the brink of the descent,
and came rolling, leaping, thundering down the mountainside,
and crashing in among the horsemen. Many were
struck down, and the horses became so terrified that the
whole body of the assailants was thrown into utter confusion.</p>

<p>Here was the opportunity of the Swiss, and they did
not let it slip. Down the pass they swept upon the bewildered
foe, and assailed them furiously with their swords,
their halberds (a heavy shaft of wood fitted with axe and
spear-point), and with their great iron-spiked clubs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The Austrians tried to turn back and escape, but in vain.
They were caught in the narrow pass as in a net. Many
sprang from their horses and tried to get away on foot;
but they slipped on the rocks, and the nimble mountaineers,
whose nailed shoes gave them good foothold on their
native slopes, and who were used to climbing over perilous
heights, caught and destroyed them easily.</p>

<p>It was hardly a battle: it was a mere slaughter. Great
numbers of the Austrians were slain on the spot; many
were driven into the lake and drowned; the rest fled.
Among the latter was Duke Leopold, who himself narrowly
escaped with his life. One who saw him on his flight from
this fatal field said that he looked "like death, and quite
distracted". Well might he look distracted. He had left
behind him a battleground drenched with the best blood
of Austria; while of the brave Swiss only fourteen men had
fallen.</p>

<p>The latter could scarce believe at first that they had
won so mighty a victory; but when they saw the Austrians
flying for their lives, and knew that the day was indeed
their own, they fell on their knees upon this forever famous
field of Morgarten, and thanked God for deliverance from
the power of Austria; and to this day a service of thanksgiving
is held every year on the anniversary of that great
fight. Year by year, on the 15th of November, Swiss men
and women visit that sacred spot where the liberty of their
land was won in one of the decisive battles of the world,
for after Morgarten the Forest Cantons never lost their
freedom again.</p>

<h2><a name="WHAT_MEKOLKA_KNOWS" id="WHAT_MEKOLKA_KNOWS">WHAT MEKOLKA KNOWS</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Here is a story of Mekolka, a little boy whose home is in the
far northern part of Russia. Mekolka is a Samoyad; that is, a
dweller on the northern coast of Russia or Siberia. The Tundra
is a wide, almost level plain without any trees.</p>

<p>As you read, make a list of the things Mekolka can do with
his hands.</p>

<p>What do you think a <i>disha</i> must be? What is a <i>toor</i>?</p>

<p>Mekolka does not know how to read print, but he can read
in the book of "all out-doors". What is the lesson he knows
best?</p>

<p>Mekolka's clothes have queer Russian names. See if you can
tell, from the way each is described, what is a <i>militza</i>, what is a
<i>soveek</i>, and what are <i>pimmies</i>?</p>

<p>How does Mekolka keep track of the months and days?</p></blockquote>

<p>If you were a little Samoyad boy, it is more than likely
that you would not go to school, unless you were one of
a family that went off in a procession of sleighs at the
beginning of every winter to some small town on the
Petchora, or even farther on to Mezen or Archangel on the
White Sea. Then there would be some small school for
you to go to while the days were dark, till the approach of
spring brought with it a new packing up and long sleigh
drive back to the haunts of seal and walrus. But it is just
as likely that there would be no school and no lessons.
Mekolka, for instance, though he has picked up a little
learning&mdash;a very little&mdash;from the Russian traders, and from
friends who have traveled over the Tundra, knows very
few of the things you know.</p>

<p>But he can use his fingers with great skill, and if he cannot
write much, he can make a beautiful pattern with one
knife on the horn handle of another one. In fact, he is
quite skilful in carving the reindeer horns. He is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
on the lookout for a good piece of horn, and whenever he
finds the shed antlers of a reindeer&mdash;for the deer cast off
their antlers and grow new ones every spring&mdash;he picks
them up and puts them to "season". There are regular
piles of these antlers about. It is the custom for everyone
to put the ones he finds on to one of these heaps, and to
take the horn he wants to work from the more seasoned
pieces at the bottom of the heap. Mekolka always chooses
his piece with great care, cuts it down to the right shape,
and as often as not decorates it with a metal pattern.
For this he has to cut his design in a regular groove all over
the horn. Having got his grooves deep and wide enough
he puts some white-looking metal on the fire in a piece of
wood scooped out like a cup. The metal soon melts, and
Mekolka pours it into the groove and prevents it from
running off by holding a piece of paper tight round the horn.
The metal cools, and the edges are cut away. Then he
polishes it with sand, after which he possesses a beautiful
knife-handle.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mekolka goes in for ornaments without
regard to use, and makes himself a ring. This time he
makes the groove in a round piece of wood, which he has
pared down to the right size, and runs in the same metal
as before, with the piece of paper held tight, to support
the metal on the under side. Then he cuts away the wood,
and brings out knife and sand for the finishing; at the end
he puts it on his finger with a look of proud content. Some
of the patterns he makes on the knife-handles are really
very beautiful, so that the Russian traders are glad to take
them away in return for snuff and tobacco.</p>

<p>Mekolka can make a sleigh and mend it when required,
throw the <i>disha</i> when he wants to catch a reindeer, and bring
it round its horn at the first throw. He can harness a team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of five correctly, and drive them like the wind. At the
gullies he is splendid; he puts the deer to a gallop when he
sees the ravine ahead; then over they go, sleigh and all,
Mekolka sitting there, proud and unmoved. Sometimes
the ravine cannot be treated this way. Then Mekolka
brings the team up to the edge and holds his <i>toor</i>&mdash;the long
driving pole&mdash;across them to make them stand evenly.
Then he dexterously removes the pole and shouts to the
deer; at once they leap together across the cleft and climb
up the steep snow wall on the other side by the grip of
their outspread hoofs. They are not long at the top with
the sleigh before Mekolka has slithered down and scrambled
up the walls of the ravine, where they are less steep and
where the ravine is not quite so narrow. He is quickly on
to his sleigh again while the deer race forwards.</p>

<p>It is cold work racing through the chill air, which is
frequently thick with an icy mist; but Mekolka is clad
from head to foot in fur. His <i>militza</i> of reindeer-skin with
fur inside often has a hood and mittens attached to it and
covers him like a smock from head to knees. On his feet
he wears <i>pimmies</i>, which reach up to the <i>militza</i>, and are
generally made of sealskin with the fur cut into strips to
form an attractive pattern. Over the <i>militza</i> he sometimes
puts a <i>soveek</i>, the Samoyad overcoat. Here the fur is worn
outside, and the garment is big and roomy.</p>

<p>After a long journey the reindeer must be unharnessed for
feeding. They find their own food, of course, and Mekolka
seizes the chance to go to sleep. He always goes to sleep
in the same queer way; he sits down on the ground, pulls
his arms out of the sleeves, and then lies flat on his back.
The empty sleeves stretch out stiffly by his side, and look,
of course, as though the arms are in them, though the
hands have found a warmer spot inside on his chest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The air on the Tundra, and, indeed, in all the Arctic
region has a curious way of deceiving the traveler. It
makes things look like something else. Take a day when
the sunshine lights up the scene and the grey, lichen-covered
mounds take wonderful colors in the distance
from the blue sky and the haze. Though lakes of water
appear to grow and fill the far-off hollows, Mekolka knows
they are not lakes, but little snowdrifts. It is the mirage
that plays these little tricks. So when he sees mighty
ships sailing over the sea, he knows it is nothing more than
blocks of ice, while what looks like a great headland on the
coast is nothing but a little mound thirty or forty feet high.
And if, when alone, he sees half a dozen other Samoyads
come to the river-bank within a couple of hundred yards
and then stop while one sits on a stone, he doesn't call out
or walk toward them; he knows quite well that in a minute
or two they will form themselves into a group of bernacle
geese, or a family of snow buntings; in fact, he is quite prepared
to hear one suddenly burst into song (for the snow
bunting is the gayest warbler of the Arctic), and to find a
cleft in the peat where there will be a nest, lined with dead
grasses and the white feathers of the willow-grouse, and
holding half a dozen eggs.</p>

<p>He knows every bird that flies overhead, and can name
them, too, though his names are very different from ours.
He knows that the snow bunting arrives about the middle
of April, and he begins to watch for its appearance as soon
as the days are getting long. He has no calendar of months
and days to look at, but he makes notches on a stick&mdash;one
for each day, with an extra cut at the seventh&mdash;and he is
just as quick in glancing at his stick and telling you the
date as an American boy would be with his printed calendar.
He will watch for the purple sandpiper in May, and find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
its eggs in June, though they are very hard to find for anyone
with eyes less trained than Mekolka's. The nest is
always built in some hollow among the Arctic willow or
lichen, and the eggs are difficult enough to see, as is the
bird itself when sitting on them&mdash;they all look so exactly
like the ground. And the bird will let you come ever so close
to her&mdash;in fact, almost tread on her&mdash;before she will leave
her cherished eggs.</p>

<p>Mekolka can tell you about the behavior of the little
stint when he came upon her nest one day. It had four
precious eggs in it. When the old bird found she was
really discovered, she jigged about like an acrobat, squeaked
like a mouse, and did everything she could to take off
Mekolka's attention from the nest. As that did not
work, the little bird twittered and pretended to be lame,
running about as though asking to be caught; but all
she wanted was that no one should notice that deep hole in
the ground half full of dried birch-leaves where her four
cherished eggs were laid. The little stint had been into a
creek in Scotland early in June, and wanted to get back
there with four chicks before the end of July. She did not
want to lose those eggs and go back all that long journey
without any little ones. Not that she is very kind to them
after they begin to grow, for on the very earliest opportunity
she kicks them out of the nest to teach them self-reliance!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BEARS_NIGHT" id="THE_BEARS_NIGHT">THE BEAR'S NIGHT</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>You should all begin reading at the same moment. When
you have finished, close your book and raise your hand. Your
teacher will divide the class into three equal groups according
to speed. She will ask you to write answers to the questions
given at the end of the story and will appoint a committee
of one pupil from each group to look the answers over and
report which of the three groups has given the best answers.</p>

<p>Have you seen the brown bears at the Zoo? Do you remember
how restlessly they walk up and down, or stand on their
hind legs and wave their noses in the air? You will not wonder
at it, when you read how independent a bear is at home, and
how cozily he spends the long, dark winter.</p></blockquote>

<p>It would seem that within or near the Arctic Circle
Nature gives a big yawn at the end of her energetic summer,
and settles down to her long winter sleep. Certainly some
of her children prepare for sleep with plenty of care,
especially Bruin, the big brown bear of Finland.</p>

<p>Even in the summer he goes sniffing round in the strong
marshlands of the north or in the forests to the east.
"That will make a good couch for me," he thinks, as he
spies a cosy nook among some big boulders. He makes
a note of the place, and goes on to look at other possible
sites. He decides nothing then, but waits till the snow comes.
Then the house-hunting must be undertaken seriously,
and he tramps through the soft white carpet, leaving a
well-marked "spoor" to tell the tale of his journeys. He
is very fat after his summer feast of berries and roots, and
his heavy body ploughs a deep furrow along the snow.</p>

<p>When once he has fixed on his boulders or tree trunks, he
becomes very suspicious, and spends several days walking
round and round his lodgings, on the watch for an enemy.
He wants to be quite sure that no one can see him go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
rest, and by going all round in a ring he catches the wind
whichever way it may be blowing. If he scents danger he is
off, and so fleet of foot is he that no hunter can catch him.
In short, Master Bruin is so much on the alert that it takes
a very wary hunter to catch him before he goes to rest.</p>

<p>Bruin is a good weather-prophet, and can sniff the signs
of a coming snow-storm better than most; so when at last
he has chosen his couch he arranges to nestle down in it
just as a heavy fall of snow is coming which will, he knows,
cover up both his trail and himself, and so conceal all his
traces from the curious. Sometimes he is a little out in
his calculations, for his furrows are so deep that nothing
short of a gale, with its heavy drifts of snow, will quite
obliterate them.</p>

<p>The hunter Finn, however, has been watching, and has
marked Bruin in his quest. He finds the "spoor" before
it is lost, and travels along it till it enters some wood or
hiding place. Then on his skis, or snowshoes, he starts
across it and describes a big circle. If he cuts the spoor
again farther on, he knows that Bruin has not yet halted,
so another circle must be described. But if the ski-er comes
back to the first line of spoor without having crossed it
again, then "honey paws" must be within his circuit.</p>

<p>The hunter keeps his secret to himself and tells no one,
because he will get the money for the skin, and also a reward
from the Government for killing the animal.</p>

<p>There is no hurry, for the bear, when once settled in his
snug quarters, will doze away quite comfortably through the
winter. His ears and nose, however, seem to keep awake,
even though his eyes are shut, and a scent of danger will
cause him to move quickly and silently away to a new couch.</p>

<p>As spring approaches, the Finn tells a few of his chosen
friends about the matter, and together they go off to hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
"Flatnose", as they often call him, before he wakes up,
thin and hungry, after his six months' fast. Warily they
search, till they see a mass of snow covering a heap of rocks
or a pile of fallen pine-trees. Then they whisper:</p>

<p>"The bear is sleeping under that heap of snow." They
fire a few guns, the dogs bark, the men shout; altogether
the bear receives a very effective morning call. He is very
easily awakened, but he is in no haste to show himself,
and waits while he thinks over matters, and prepares for a
strategic and rapid retreat, for he has met danger before,
and found his fleetness his greatest defence. In the meantime
the hunters have fired a few shots into his retreat in
the hope of stinging him into action, but they probably
hit only his protective stones. Then they gather twigs and
branches together and light a bonfire at his very door, or
what they guess to be his door, trusting that the wind will
carry the smoke to his nostrils. Some of their efforts
succeed in their object; there is an upheaving of the snow;
Flatnose pushes out his head. Then follow the shoulders
and front paws, and soon the huge brown body rises as he
sits upright on his haunches. He gives a terrific growl,
which shows he is not to be trifled with; and, indeed, this
is his most dangerous time, for he is very hungry after his
long foodless sleep, and ready to attack anything&mdash;cow,
reindeer, or man.</p>

<p>The dogs are much too frightened to go near him. They
bark at a distance. One man fires a shot and hits. The
bear shows his teeth and hisses as he makes a rush forwards.
Another shot makes him look round, and the dogs grow
bolder. A shot in the muzzle makes him quite furious,
and he springs at one of the dogs. He catches one dog by
the back and flings it howling over the snow. Then he
springs at the other, and tears his ear or paw. Wild with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
fury, he rushes toward his attackers, but between them
he is soon laid low, and carried off in a sleigh. His skin
alone will be worth many dollars, and the flesh more, so
that with the Government grant, the men will have a
comfortable little sum each as a result of their hunting.</p>

<p>It is not without danger, this bear-hunt, neither is it
certain of success; for if the bear once dodges the early
shots, he will manage to get through the trees and disappear
in a way that is almost uncanny. So when a man has once
been on a bear-hunt and brought his prey safely home,
he becomes a hero in his village.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHINESE_NEW_YEARS_DAY" id="THE_CHINESE_NEW_YEARS_DAY">THE CHINESE NEW YEAR'S DAY</a></h2>


<p>At New Year time Hok-a, the Chinese boy, and Gold-needle,
his sister, and their cousins always have plenty of
fun. Their grandmother once told them a story of why
there was always so much feasting then. She said:</p>

<p>"They tell us that the people of long ago had a saying
that on the last day of the twelfth month a great flood
would drown everyone. When the people of that time
heard this, they were very sad, and thought, 'Now we are
going to die, let us take the food we have and eat, and the
clothes we have and dress up gaily'. So they took rice,
and fried rice-cakes, and prepared strained rice and basins
of vegetables, in order to take leave of their ancestors.
(The 'ancestors' mean the spirits of their ancestors, who
are supposed to live in wooden tablets kept on a table
placed against the wall of the chief room.) When they
had worshipped the ancestors, all the family sat together
round the table to eat their rice and put a little stove underneath
because it was winter, and they needed a fire to
warm themselves. On that night they shut the door very
close and put a prop against it. They did not dare to go
to sleep, but watched anxiously for the flood to come.</p>

<p>"At daybreak they opened the door, and discovered that
there was no flood. That was New Year's Day. They
immediately ran out to visit their friends and relatives,
and found that none of them had been drowned either;
so they all congratulated one another, and drank tea and
wine. From that time there have always been feasting and
visiting and congratulations at New Year."</p>

<p>Hok-a and Gold-needle have been looking forward to
the holiday for a long time. All the people in the house
have been busy for days. The dust and dirt of the year
has been swept from the house into the street. The men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
have been hurrying about collecting any money that was
owing to them, for no bills must be left over till New Year.
Mother and aunts have been sitting by the door to catch the
light to darn, and mend, and make, for everyone must have
something fine to wear on New Year's day. Such a cooking
goes on the day before! and such a frying of rice flour cakes
you never saw. Pigs and ducks and chickens and even
poor little fish have a bad time of it just then.</p>

<p>The great day arrives, and Hok-a and Gold-needle dress
themselves in their new clothes. Hok-a has a blue coat,
with a yellow silk waistcoat on the top of it, green silk
anklets, and a green cap; while his little sister is gay in a
pink coat and blue trousers trimmed with black, and wears
some silver pins and cloth flowers in her shining black hair.</p>

<p>By twelve o'clock all is ready. The men and boys, in
long blue or green gowns, are gathered in the hall, and
prostrate themselves three times begging the idols and the
spirits of their ancestors to eat the food prepared for them.
A basin of rice and another of vegetables, with a piece of
meat, is carried to the bed-room for the Mother Bed Spirit
to eat, as, if they don't feed her, she will revenge herself by
tripping up the children. The Kitchen God, too, must have
his share, and the fireplace is gaily decorated with flowers.</p>

<p>When they have finished worshipping, a lot of silver
and paper money is burnt, that the spirits may buy good
things in the other world, and have a nice time. Then all
the family gather round for the feast of the year. Usually
the men eat alone and the women afterwards, but on this
day everyone has a place. Such fun they have, roasting
cockles and parching beans! Everyone must give a stir
to the bean-pan. A little stove is carried to the table, and
wine is warmed over it, for all to have a taste. A great
supply of celery has been laid in, and the stalks must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
boiled and swallowed whole, to give long life. When the
feast is finished, the grandfather hands a piece of money
to each, so that they may have money the year through.
Then a basin of rice and a bit of meat is given to the dog,
a treat he gets only once a year. It is time to light up
now. A bit of sugar-cane is stuck behind each door, and in
each room food is placed for the spirits. There is so much
noise and merriment that, for a wonder, the rats don't
dare to peep out; so they say that "the rats are marrying
and giving in marriage". Twelve bamboo lamps are lighted
in the hall, and afterwards carried out to burn. Everybody
gathers round to watch which goes out first, as each lantern
stands for a month, and the first that burns black means
a month of rain. If it is the first month the children are
sad, for that is holiday-time. And it usually is the first,
as it is carried out before the others.</p>

<p>Our little friend Hok-a has been saving up for weeks,
so as to buy plenty of squibs and fireworks to let off on this
day, just as American boys used to do for the 4th of July.
His father has bought hundreds of them, too, and so has
everyone else in the place; the cracking of them is heard
everywhere.</p>

<p>A great bonfire is kindled, and the children jump over it,

<h2><a name="ADDING_THE_RIGHT_WORDS2" id="ADDING_THE_RIGHT_WORDS2">ADDING THE RIGHT WORDS</a></h2>


<p>This drill is given to see how well you can follow printed
directions, and how well you understand the way the words
are grouped at the bottom of the page. There is something
for you to write in each of the following paragraphs, and your
ability to read and understand will be judged by how exactly
you follow these directions.</p>

<p>1. Arrange your paper with your name on the first line to
the right, and your grade below it on the second line.</p>

<p>2. Do not write anything on the third line, but on the next
six lines in the margin, write the figures from 1 to 10.</p>

<p>3. The first group of words at the bottom of the page is a
list of farm-products; you can easily name other words that
might be added to this list, such as:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">beans&nbsp; rye&nbsp; oats</span><br />
</p>

<p>Write two of these new words after figure 1 on your paper.</p>

<p>4. There are nine other lists of words, and each list names
not farm-products, but some other things. After figure 2 on
your paper, write two other words that could properly be
added to the second group of words.</p>

<p>5. In the same way, write two more words that could
rightly belong to each of the other eight groups of words.
When you finish wait quietly for the others.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">1. corn, potatoes, wheat, peas.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">2. chisel, plane, file, axe.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">3. creek, ocean, gulf, sea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">4. fireman, librarian, teacher, physician.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">5. overcoat, fur cap, overshoes, muffler.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">6. meat, horns, tallow, hair.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">7. pencil, pen, blotter, stamps.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">8. cup, saucer, plate, bowl.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">9. door, window, stairs, chimney.</span><br />

<h2><a name="THE_GOOD_CITIZEN_HOW_HE_USES" id="THE_GOOD_CITIZEN_HOW_HE_USES">THE GOOD CITIZEN&mdash;HOW HE USES
MATCHES</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>There are two things you can do with every good and useful
thing&mdash;use it and abuse it. Here you are going to read about
the abuse of a very useful thing, indeed&mdash;a match. When
things are a common, everyday part of the household, people
are apt to treat them carelessly; and carelessness always means
trouble. As you read, think whether anything in this article
hits <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>This is a good selection to outline. Perhaps your teacher will
have some of the best outlines put on the blackboard.</p></blockquote>

<p>The match is one of the most valuable and one of the
most dangerous articles made by man. It has been in use
for less than one hundred years, but think of trying to get
along without it!</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that you were camping far from
any houses, and discovered, when the time came to cook
dinner, that you had lost your matches. What would you
do? Would you rub sticks together like the Indian or
make a "bow-drill" like the Eskimo? These were the
methods used by mankind for thousands and thousands
of years, but they mean desperately hard work, as you
would soon realize. You would be fortunate if you could
find a bit of flint from which to strike sparks with steel
as your great-grandfather probably did. But even in that
case you would appreciate matches as never before.</p>

<p>It was not until the year 1827 that an English druggist
named John Walker made the first practical friction-matches,
known as "Congreves". A folded piece of glass-paper
went with every box, and in order to light the match
one had to draw it in one hand quickly through the folds
of the paper held tightly pressed together with the other.
Another kind of match, the "Promethean", appeared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
little later. It had at one end a thin glass globule, which
it was necessary to press in producing fire.</p>

<p>Thus people went on experimenting, for everyone was
interested and there was great demand. Gradually methods
of making that were better and cheaper were discovered,
until, to-day, matches are found in every home.</p>

<p>It is said that more matches are sold in the United States
than in all the rest of the world. More than seven hundred
million matches are used in the United States each day.
You can hardly imagine such a figure. If a factory made
just one match for every minute, night and day, it would
take nearly fourteen hundred years for it to produce as
many matches as this country uses in a single day. Or&mdash;to
put it in another way&mdash;nearly five hundred thousand
flames are struck every minute on an average. There is
not one of these flames that would not develop into a
destructive fire if it had a chance. Consequently, every
match must be regarded, and must be treated, as a possible
source of great damage.</p>

<p>Matches, to-day, are of two general classes: Those which
may be struck upon any rough surface, and the so-called
"safety matches", made to be struck only upon the box.
But there are good matches and bad matches in both classes.
In other words, while the safety match, as a rule, is safer
than the kind first mentioned, a poorly made strike-on-the-box
match may be more dangerous than a well-made
strike-anywhere match. Therefore, we ought to know
something about what a match is, as well as how to use it.</p>

<p>Here is a match. What could appear more harmless?
A tiny stick of wood, shorter than your finger, coated at one
end with some substance that forms a little bulb, or head&mdash;who
would believe that it can be either a blessing or a
deadly peril, according to the way in which it is used?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The secret of fire-production lies in the head of the match.
This contains certain chemicals which take fire easily when
heated, and it also contains particles of ground flint in
order to create heat by friction when the match is struck.
If two objects are rubbed quickly together, the resulting
friction brings heat, and all the more easily and quickly if
one of the objects be rough. If you sandpaper a board,
rubbing it hard, you will soon find both paper and board becoming
warm. Thus friction from striking a match produces
sufficient heat to cause the head to burst into flame.</p>

<p>Now, it must be remembered that even careful persons
may meet with accidents through the use of bad matches.
Sometimes, when struck, the blazing head will fly off, or
the stick will break and fall; sometimes, too, the match will
continue to glow after the flame has been blown out.
These are signs that the match is poorly made; probably
it is of some very cheap brand, for such things never happen
with good matches. Carefulness, therefore, must begin
at the time of buying. One should always notice the brand
and always order by brand. Whenever a brand is found
to have any of these faults it should be avoided in future,
no matter how low the price may be.</p>

<p>The best of the strike-anywhere matches are given a
special treatment to keep the head from flying off when
struck, and also to guard it from being set on fire accidentally.
Great care is also taken in the preparation of the
wood to safeguard against breaking. But as a class, the
safety matches are less dangerous.</p>

<p>Matches of all kinds are carefully tested in the great
Underwriters' Laboratories, which The National Board of
Fire Underwriters maintains in Chicago, and those that
are able to pass the test are labeled by the Laboratories.
It is always a protection to find one of these labels on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
box. The Laboratories have no interest in the sale of
matches, and any manufacturer who will make goods of the
right grade can secure the label.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that your house is provided with good
matches, those having solid heads and tough sticks. There
will be no danger if you are always careful when using them.
But are you? Here are some questions for you to answer.</p>

<p>Do you ever throw away a match which is burning or
even glowing? Never do this again. It has caused
hundreds of deaths and has burned thousands of homes.</p>

<p>How do you strike a match&mdash;away from you or toward
you? Probably you have never thought about this, but
think of it hereafter, and form the habit of always striking
<i>away</i> from you. Thus, if the match breaks or its head
flies off, it will not be likely to set fire to your clothing.
In lighting matches upon a box, first <i>close the box</i>; otherwise
the flame may set fire to the whole box. If the box is set
in a box-holder, such as those used by smokers, wherein
the upper part of the box is open, place the box so that the
heads are not exposed. In striking a match upon such a
holder, always strike downward away from the open end.</p>

<p>If matches are spilled, do you stop at once and pick up
every one? If you leave them strewn about for even a
little while, you may forget them until after mischief has
been done. A match on the floor is always a dangerous
thing. It may be stepped on and ignited, or it may be
found by a little child, or it may be carried into the wall
or under the floor by a rat or mouse. It is not probable
that mice often start fires by gnawing match-heads, but
they do like to use them in building nests in warm, comfortable
places, close to chimneys or furnace pipes. Dangerous
fires may come from this cause or from matches rubbed
against beams while being carried to the nest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>Where do you keep your matches? Are they out of
reach of little children, as they always should be? Are
they kept away from the stove, or the stovepipe, or any
other place where they may become overheated? Are
they loose in a drawer or on a shelf, or are they in a covered
box or dish of metal or earthenware? Sometimes uncovered
matches are ignited by the sun's rays shining through a
lens-forming bubble in a window-pane.</p>

<p>Do you carry matches on your person? A child should
never be allowed to do this. He may be careful, but some
careless child may ask him for a match. Always be on
the safe side. A grown person should never permit himself
to carry loose matches in his pocket. The State Fire
Marshal of Iowa says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some men, especially smokers, are in the habit of
carrying matches around with them. It is the easiest
thing in the world for matches carried around loose
in a man's pocket to drop out. Suppose the man has
work to do about a barn. A match drops out on the
barn floor and a horse steps on it. It is a parlor-match
and ignites, setting fire to hay and other inflammable
material found in barns. Then the barn burns and the
cause of fire is reported something like this:</p>

<p>"Unknown. Nobody had been in the barn for some
time. Everything safe when the barn was closed up."</p>

<p>Six hundred and ninety-four barn fires took place in
Iowa in 1914. Hundreds of these were reported as of
unknown origin, but it is safe to say that in a great
number of cases, if the cause could have been traced, it
would have been found to be a match that had dropped
out of a smoker's pocket.</p></blockquote>

<p>Until we find some better device for producing fire,
matches will continue to be used in immense numbers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
they will always be a source of danger in the hands of
careless people, and even careful people may be imperiled
by the actions of careless people about them. There are
no safety-rules more important than those applying to the
use of matches, and habits of carefulness should be formed
by every person. Some one has said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Matches do not think with their heads. When you
use them, your head has to do all the thinking. Do
the thinking! Put them out!</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Safety Rules for Buying Matches</span></p>

<blockquote><p>1. Purchase by brand, and always avoid brands which break,
lose their heads, or glow after being blown out.</p>

<p>2. Look for the label of the Underwriters' Laboratories.</p>

<p>3. Give the preference to strike-on-the-box, or safety
matches, but, in case of buying the strike-anywhere match,
get one that has a protected tip.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Safety Rules for Using Matches</span></p>

<blockquote><p>1. Keep them in covered boxes or dishes, away from the
heat of stoves and stovepipes and out of the reach of rats and
mice.</p>

<p>2. Strike matches away from you. If you are striking on
a box, first close the box. Strike downward on the box.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>Noblesse oblige</i> is a French expression (pronounced n&#333;bl&#277;ss´
&#333;bleejh´) which means, "High birth or position makes one
responsible for the good of those lower than he in position".
The following story tells of a British officer during the World
War who did not forget this motto. The story was told by
the writer of a book narrating experiences at the front. As
you read, think how you would have felt if you had been one
of the young colonel's men.</p></blockquote>

<p>A great love and sympathy always seem to exist between
the British officer and his men. One of the reasons is the
justice and unselfishness of the officer. For instance, a
British officer among the walking wounded never goes
ahead of his men to have his wounds dressed.</p>

<p>Outside of one dressing station sat a young colonel with
a bad wound. One of the secretaries noticed him and said,
"You had better get into the dressing station at once."</p>

<p>"It is not my turn. I will not go out of turn."</p>

<p>Some four hours later, the secretary, passing out food
and drink, again noticed the colonel.</p>

<p>"Here! Why haven't you had your wounds dressed?"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I am waiting for my turn."</p>

<p>"But it was your turn a long time ago."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Come, let me help you."</p>

<blockquote><p>Here is another Arabian fairy tale. It is much longer than
the story of the queer man who was made Caliph for a day
and is also very different from that tale. But it is a fine story
of adventure filled with surprises and with all the changes of
fortune that fairy stories so often have. Of course, all sixth
grade boys and girls know that the Indian who is spoken of
is an East Indian of Asia and not a North American Indian.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the Nevrouz, that is to say, the new day, which is the
first of the year, and the beginning of the spring, an ancient
and solemn feast was observed through all Persia. At the
court, this feast was always attended with the greatest
splendor. All artists, natives or strangers, were allowed
at that time to produce their several inventions before the
king; who never failed to confer liberal rewards on those
whose abilities deserved them.</p>

<p>Near the close of one of these feasts, an Indian presented
himself before the king with an artificial horse of the most
perfect workmanship, richly accoutred. "I flatter myself,
sir," said the Indian, addressing himself to the king, "that
your majesty hath never seen anything so wonderful as
this horse, either now, or at any former Nevrouz." The
king surveyed the horse with attention. "I see nothing,"
said he, "but a fine piece of sculpture, which any able artist
may equal."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the Indian, "it is not his form, but his use
that I commend so highly. On his back I can convey myself
through the air to the most distant part of the earth, in a
very short time. I can even instruct any other person to
ride in the same manner. Such is the curiosity I have the
honor to present to your majesty's notice."</p>

<p>The king was highly pleased with this account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Indian's horse, and desired to see a proof of his abilities.
"There is," said the king, pointing to a mountain about
three leagues off, "on the summit of that mountain, a palm-tree
of a particular quality, which I should know from all
others; go, fetch me a branch of it."</p>

<p>The Indian mounted his horse, and turning a peg which
was in the neck, away he flew with him, and they were presently
out of sight. Within a quarter of an hour he was seen
returning with a palm branch in his hand, which, as soon as
he had descended and alighted, he laid at the king's feet.</p>

<p>The king was greatly pleased with this extraordinary performance,
and resolved to purchase the horse if he could
prevail with the owner to part with him. Accordingly, he
asked the Indian if he was to be sold. "Sir," replied the
Indian, "I should not have produced my horse to your majesty
if it had been absolutely impossible for me to sell
him. Yet the artist from whom I received him, laid me
under the most solemn injunction that I should never part
with him for money; nor on any terms but such as I
might request your pardon before I presume to name them."</p>

<p>The king impatiently answered that he forgave his demand,
even if it was to reach his crown; but he reserved
to himself the power of refusal, if he thought that demand
too exorbitant. The Indian then replied that he was ready
to resign his horse if his majesty would condescend to bestow
on him the princess, his daughter, in marriage.</p>

<p>When the courtiers heard this extravagant request, they
all burst into loud laughter; but the prince Firouz Shah,
the only son of the king, was enraged, and the more so when
he saw the king pensive, debating with himself what answer
to return. Going up to his father, he said, "I entreat your
majesty will pardon the liberty I am about to take, but is
it possible you can hesitate a moment what answer to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to this insolent fellow? Can you bear to think of degrading
our house by an alliance with a scandalous juggler?"</p>

<p>The king approved of his son's spirit, but argued that if
he refused to comply with the Indian's proposal, perhaps
some other sovereign might be less nice, and by that means
become possessed of the greatest curiosity in the world. He
ended his reply by desiring his son to examine the horse
attentively, and give his opinion of him.</p>

<p>Respect for his father made him receive these orders in
silence. He approached the horse, and the Indian drew near
to instruct the prince in the method of managing him; but
the haughty young man was in too great a fury to listen
to him. He spurned the kneeling Indian contemptuously,
and leaping into the saddle, he turned the peg, and the
horse flew away with him.</p>

<p>The Indian was exceedingly alarmed when he saw the
prince depart before he had learned how to manage the
horse. He threw himself once more at the king's feet, and
besought his majesty not to blame him for any accident
which might befall the prince, since his own impetuosity
had exposed him to danger. The king had no apprehension
for his son, till he saw the Indian so terrified. He then felt
all the horrors of the prince's situation. He cursed the
Indian and his fatal horse, and ordered his officers to seize
and conduct him to prison. "If my son does not return
safe," said he, "in a short time, thy paltry life, at least, shall
be sacrificed to my vengeance."</p>

<p>In the meantime, Firouz Shah was carried through the air
with inconceivable swiftness, till at length he could scarcely
discern the earth at all. He then wished to return, which he
expected to do by turning the peg the contrary way; but
when he found the horse continued to rise from the earth,
and proceed forward at the same time with greater swiftness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
he was alarmed and began to regret his pride and
anger. He turned the peg about every way to no purpose;
in this situation he retained, notwithstanding, a perfect presence
of mind, and, on examining the horse closely, he at last
perceived another peg behind the ear. On turning that peg
he presently found that he descended in the same oblique
manner that he had mounted, but not so swiftly.</p>

<p>As he drew near the earth, he lost the light by degrees,
till he came into total darkness. He did not attempt, therefore,
to guide the horse, but waited patiently, though not
without apprehension, till he should alight.</p>

<p>It was midnight when the horse stopped, and Firouz dismounted,
faint with hunger and fatigue. He groped about
and found he was on the roof of some large building. At
length he came to some steps, which he descended, and rambled
about in the dark for some time; at last, on opening
a door, he found a light, and saw a number of black guards
asleep on pallets, with their sabres lying by them. This
convinced him that he was in a palace, and that this chamber
was the guard room of some princess. As he knew if
any of the guards should awake he would be in great danger,
he resolved to enter the next apartment, and throw himself
on the mercy of the lady who inhabited it.</p>

<p>He found there asleep on a sofa a young lady, whose exquisite
beauty captivated his heart the moment he beheld
her. Her women were sleeping in little beds around her.
The prince gazed on her for a long time, forgetful of his
situation; and, at length he knelt down, and gently pulling
her hand toward him, he kissed it.</p>

<p>The motion awakened the princess, who was surprised to
find a stranger at her bedside. She would have cried out,
but Firouz besought her patience. He told her that he was
the son of a king, and that a very extraordinary accident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
which he would relate, had brought him to the necessity of
claiming her protection.</p>

<p>The lady was the daughter of the king of Bengal. Many
of her attendants were by this time awakened. She told
Firouz, therefore, that she should be glad to hear the particulars
of his adventure in the morning, but for the present
besought him to withdraw. At the same time she
ordered her attendants to conduct him to a chamber, and
supply him with such refreshments as he wanted.</p>

<p>The prince attended her the next day and related to her
all the particulars of the arrival of the Indian with his
horse, of his insolent demand, and its consequences. He
concluded his account of his journey by observing that however
much he had been enraged at the Indian, he now began
to consider him his benefactor; "since," added he, "he has
been the cause of my being known to a lady whose chains
I shall be proud to wear as long as I live."</p>

<p>The princess received this compliment in such a manner
as showed it was very acceptable to her. She invited the
prince to repose a few days in her palace to recover himself
from the fatigue and alarm he had undergone. He accepted
this invitation; and being much together, they fell
more and more in love with each other. And, at last, when
filial duty obliged Firouz to think of returning to Persia,
the fond princess, fearing she should see him no more, dropped
a hint that she should not be afraid to trust herself with
him on the enchanted horse; and the prince, equally enamored,
failed not to confirm her in this rash adventure.</p>

<p>Everything being agreed on between the lovers, they repaired,
one morning at daybreak, to the roof where the
horse still remained; and Firouz assisted the princess to
mount him. He then placed himself before her, and
turning the peg, they were out of sight before any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
attendants in the palace were stirring; and in two hours the
prince discovered the capital of Persia.</p>

<p>He would not alight at the king's palace, but directed his
course to a small cottage in a wood, a little distance from
town, that he might inform his father who the lady was,
and secure her a reception suitable to her dignity. When
they alighted, he led her into a handsome apartment, and
ordered the keeper of the house to show her all imaginable
respect. Then he hastened to the palace, where the king
received him with unspeakable joy. Firouz related to his
father all that had befallen him, and the king was so delighted
with his son's safe arrival, that he readily complied
with his desire that the wedding ceremonies between him
and the princess should be immediately celebrated.</p>

<p>While the necessary preparations were being made, the
king ordered the Indian, who was to have been executed the
next day, to be released from prison, and brought before
him. "My son's safe arrival," said the king to him, "hath
preserved thy life. Take thy horse, and begone from my
dominions; where, if thou art ever seen again, I will not
fail to put thee to death." The Indian being then freed
from his chains, and set at liberty, withdrew in silence.</p>

<p>But he meditated a severe revenge. He had learned from
those who fetched him out of prison, that Firouz had
brought home with him a beautiful princess, to whom he
was about to be married. He was told also that she was at
the house in the wood, where he was directed to go and take
away his horse. While Firouz was preparing a great
retinue to conduct the princess in state to the palace, the
Indian hastened to the house in the wood, and told the
keeper he was sent by the prince to conduct her, on the
horse, to the capital; and that the whole court and people
were waiting with impatience for the wonderful sight.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The keeper knew that the Indian had been imprisoned
on account of the prince's absence; and, seeing him now
at liberty, he believed all he said. He presented the traitor
to the princess, who, not doubting but he came from Firouz,
readily agreed to go with him. The Indian, overjoyed at
his success, mounted his horse, took the princess behind
him, and turning the peg, the horse immediately ascended
into the air. The king and his whole court were on the
road to the house in the wood, to conduct the princess of
Bengal from thence to the palace; when the Indian, to
brave them, and revenge the severe treatment he had received,
passed several times over their heads with his prize.
The rage and grief of the king were extreme. He loaded
the villain with a thousand execrations, in which he was
joined by the courtiers and people. The Indian, having
expressed his contempt for them, and his triumph over the
king and his son, was presently out of sight.</p>

<p>But who can describe the horror and despair of Firouz,
when he saw his beloved princess torn from him by a vile
Indian he so thoroughly detested, and found himself unable
to afford her the least assistance. At first he abandoned
himself to despair; but, recollecting that such a conduct
would neither recover the princess nor punish the captor,
he restrained his affliction, and began to consider how he
could best effect these desirable purposes. He put on the
habit of a dervish, and left the palace the same evening,
uncertain which way to go, but determined not to return
till he had found his princess again.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Indian having pursued his journey
for several hours, alighted in a wood, near the capital of
Cashmere. As he was hungry himself, and doubted not but
the princess was so too, he left her by the side of a brook and
flew away on the horse to the city to procure provisions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
The princess made the best use in her power of his absence;
and though faint for want of food, she traveled on, and had
got a considerable distance from the place where he left her,
when she had the mortification to see him return and alight
close by her; for the Indian had wished to be set down
wherever the princess was, and the horse always obeyed
the desire of the rider.</p>

<p>The Indian produced some wine and provisions, and ate
heartily, urging her to follow his example, which she thought
it best to do. When they had done, he drew near and
began to pay his addresses to the princess, which she
repulsed with indignation. Her outcries drew a company
of horsemen to her assistance.</p>

<p>They proved to be the sultan of Cashmere and his attendants,
returning from a day's hunting. When the sultan
asked of the Indian why he annoyed the lady, he
boldly answered that she was his wife; but the princess,
though she knew not the quality of the sultan, besought
his protection, and declared that by the basest deceit only
she had been thrown into the power of such a reptile.</p>

<p>The sultan of Cashmere was very chivalrous. The disorder
and distress of the princess added to her beauty and
interested the monarch. Judging that, whether the Indian
was the husband of the lady or not, he would be best out of
the way, he pretended to be much enraged against him,
and ordered his head to be stuck off immediately. He then
conducted the princess to his palace, and directed his attendants
to bring the horse after them, though he knew
nothing of the use of it.</p>

<p>The princess of Bengal rejoiced at her deliverance. She
entertained hopes that the sultan of Cashmere would generously
restore her to the prince of Persia; but she was
much deceived; for as soon as the sultan learned that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
was daughter to the king of Bengal, he determined to marry
her, and that no untoward circumstances might happen to
prevent it, he gave orders for the necessary preparations to
be completed by the next day.</p>

<p>In the morning the princess was awakened early by the
sounding of trumpets, the beating of drums, and other noisy
tokens of public joy, which echoed through the palace and
city. On her asking the cause of this rejoicing, she was
told it was to celebrate her marriage with their sultan,
which was to take place presently.</p>

<p>The princess' attachment to Firouz would have made any
other man disagreeable to her. But this conduct of the
sultan of Cashmere in proclaiming their nuptials, without
even having asked her consent, at once enraged and terrified
her. She was entirely in his power; and the disrespect
he had paid her convinced her that she had everything to
fear from his violence, if she refused to comply with his
wishes.</p>

<p>Thus critically situated, she had recourse to art. She
arose and dressed herself fancifully, and in her whole behavior
appeared to her women to be unsettled in her intellect.
The sultan was soon told of his misfortune, and on
his approach she put on the appearance of frenzy, and
endeavored to fly at him; and this fury she ever after affected
whenever he came in her sight. The sultan was
much disturbed at this unfortunate event, as he thought it,
and offered large rewards to any physician who could cure
her, but the princess would not suffer any one to come near
her, so that all hope of her recovery began to be despaired of.</p>

<p>During this interval, Firouz, disguised as a dervish, had
traveled through many provinces, full of grief, and uncertain
which way to direct his course in search of his beloved
princess. At last, passing through a town in India, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
heard an account that a princess of Bengal had run mad
on the day of the celebration of her nuptials with the sultan
of Cashmere. Slender as was the hope that such a report
gave him, he resolved to travel to the capital of that
kingdom; where, when he arrived, he had the happiness to find
he had not journeyed in vain. He learned all the particulars
of her having been delivered from the Indian by their sultan,
and that the very next day she was seized with madness.</p>

<p>Firouz saw at once the reason of the princess' conduct,
and was delighted with this tender proof of her love and
constancy to him. All the difficulty which remained was
to obtain an opportunity of speaking to her. To gain this,
he put on the clothes of a physician, and, presenting himself
to the sultan, undertook to cure the princess.</p>

<p>His services being accepted, he desired first to see her,
without being seen by her. For this purpose he was conveyed
into a closet, whence he saw her unobserved. She
was carelessly singing a song, in which she deplored the
unhappy fate which had forever deprived her of the object
she loved so tenderly. When he quitted the closet, he
told the sultan she was not incurable, but that it was necessary
for him to speak with her alone; and that notwithstanding
her violent fits at the sight of physicians, he knew
how to make her attend to him.</p>

<p>As the princess had been long thought incurable, the
sultan made no difficulty of complying with the supposed
physician's request. As soon as he entered her apartment,
she began to rave at him in her usual furious manner, on
which he went up close to her, and said, in a low voice, "I
am the prince of Persia."</p>

<p>The princess ceased to rave, and the attendants withdrew,
rejoiced at this proof of the physician's abilities.
After mutual congratulations, Firouz acquainted her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
the plan he had formed for her deliverance. He then returned
to the sultan, who demanded eagerly what hopes he
now entertained. The pretended physician shook his head,
and said, "All depends upon a mere chance; the princess, a
few hours before she was taken ill, had touched something
that was enchanted. Unless I can obtain that something,
whatever it may be, I cannot cure her."</p>

<p>The sultan of Cashmere presently recollected the horse,
which was still preserved in his treasury. He showed it
to the imaginary physician, who, on seeing it, very gravely
said, "I congratulate your majesty on the certainty of my
success. Let this horse be brought out into the great square
before the palace, and let the princess attend; I will promise
that in a few minutes she shall be perfectly cured."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the following morning the horse was placed
in the middle of the square, and the supposed physician
drew a large circle, and placed around it chafing dishes,
with a little fire in each. The sultan, full of expectation,
with all his nobles and ministers of state, attended. The
princess was brought out veiled, conducted within the circle,
and the physician placed her on the enchanted horse. He
then went round to each chafing dish, and threw in a certain
drug, which presently raised such a cloud of smoke
that neither the physician, the princess, nor the horse could
be seen through it. At that instant the prince of Persia
mounted the horse; and, turning the peg, while the horse
ascended into the air, he distinctly pronounced these words:
"Sultan of Cashmere, when thou wouldst marry princesses
who implore thy protection, learn first to obtain their consent."</p>

<p>The same day the prince of Persia and his beloved princess
arrived safely at his father's court, when their nuptials
were immediately celebrated with the greatest splendor.</p>

<h2><a name="WHAT_IS_A_BOY_SCOUT" id="WHAT_IS_A_BOY_SCOUT">WHAT IS A BOY SCOUT?</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Perhaps you are a Boy Scout already, though not a very big
one. Perhaps you intend to be one some day. In this description
of the best kind of Scout, find reasons why you would like
to be one.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Scout enjoys a hike through the woods more than
he does a walk in the city streets. He can tell north or
south or east or west by the "signs." He can tie a knot
that will hold; he can climb a tree which seems impossible
to others; he can swim a river; he can pitch a tent; he
can mend a tear in his trousers; he can tell you which
fruits and seeds are poisonous and which are not; he can
sight nut-bearing trees from a distance. If he lives near
the ocean or a lake he can reef a sail or take his trick at the
wheel, and, if near any body of water at all he can pull an oar
or use paddles and sculls; in the woods he knows the names
of birds and animals; in the water he tells you the different
varieties of fish.</p>

<p>A Scout walks through the woods with silent tread.
No dry twigs snap under his feet, and no loose stones turn
over and throw him off his balance. His eyes are keen
and he sees many things that others do not see. He
sees tracks and signs which reveal to him the nature and
habits of the creatures that made them. He knows how
to stalk birds and animals and how to study them in their
natural haunts. He sees much, but is little seen.</p>

<p>A Scout, like an old frontiersman, does not shout his
wisdom from the housetops. He possesses the quiet power
that comes from knowledge. He speaks softly and answers
questions modestly. He knows a braggart but he does
not challenge him, allowing the boaster to expose his ignorance
by his own loose-wagging tongue.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>A Scout can kindle a fire in the forest on the wettest day,
and he seldom uses more than one match. When no
matches can be had, he can still have a fire, for he knows
the secret of the rubbing sticks used by the Indians, and he
knows how to start a blaze with only his knife blade and
a piece of flint. He knows, also, the danger of forest fires;
so he kindles a blaze that will not spread. The fire once
started, what a meal he can prepare out there in the open!
Just watch him and compare his appetite with that of a
boy who lounges at a lunch counter in a crowded city.
He knows the unwritten rules of the campfire, and he contributes
his share to the pleasures of the council. He also
knows when to sit silent before the ruddy embers and give
his mind free play.</p>

<p>A Scout holds his honor to be his most precious possession,
and he would rather die than have it stained. He
knows what is his duty, and all obligations imposed by
duty he fulfills of his own free will. His sense of honor is
his only task-master, and his honor he guards as jealously
as did the knights of old. In this manner a Scout wins
the confidence and respect of all people.</p>

<p>A Scout practices self-control, for he knows that men who
master problems in the world must first master themselves.
He keeps a close guard on his tongue, for he knows that
loud speech is often a cloak to ignorance, that swearing
is a sign of weakness, and that untruthfulness shatters the
confidence of others. He keeps a close guard on his appetite
and eats moderately of food which will make him
strong; he never uses alcoholic liquors because he does
not wish to poison his body; he desires a clear, active brain,
so he avoids tobacco.</p>

<p>A Scout never flinches in the face of danger; for he knows
that at such a time every faculty must be alert to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
his safety and that of others. He knows what to do in
case of fire, or panic, or shipwreck; he trains his mind to
direct and his body to act. In all emergencies he sets an
example of resourcefulness, coolness and courage, and
considers the safety of others before that of himself. He
is especially considerate of the helpless and weak.</p>

<p>A Scout can make himself known to a brother Scout
wherever he may be by a method which only Scouts can
know. He has brothers in every city in the land and in
every country in the world. Wherever he goes he can give
his signs and be assured of a friendly welcome. He can
talk with a brother Scout without making a sound or he
can make known his message by imitating the click of a
telegraph key.</p>

<p>Before the years were counted or the circuit of the seasons
reckoned, man lived where it was always summer, and summer
heat ruled the Northland, now ruled by winter cold.
As the scepter of the Frost King reached farther and farther
south, men slowly and reluctantly retreated from the
old homes. But some lingered through the fireless winters
for the love of the familiar places and the beauty of the
northern spring and summer.</p>

<p>Among those who lingered was Ang, the mighty hunter.
His home was in a cave at the edge of the great forest.
It faced the south so that it could catch all the scant rays
of the winter's sun. The mouth of the cave was partly
closed by a screen of fir boughs, while a bark slab, torn
from a big tree, formed a rude door. Inside the cave were
bunks piled high with dry moss and leaves, with the skins
of animals which Ang had slain thrown over them.</p>

<p>It was not yet midwinter, but it was cold, bitter cold.
As Ang sat in front of his cave, chipping knife blades and
arrow points from flint, he moved from time to time to
keep in the feeble light of the sun, but it seemed to have
little warmth, and he shivered and grumbled to himself:
"Every year the cold grows stronger. The old men tell
of a time when it came late and went soon, but that must
have been long ago. Ugh! but it is cold! It gets under my
bearskin; it nips my ears and numbs my hands. I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
I had taken the long journey to the Southland, but
it was far for the woman and the child, and I hoped that
the Ice Giant would grow old and lose his strength&mdash;and
I was born here; my father and my father's father hunted
in these woods and fished in this river, and men, like trees,
take root."</p>

<p>The sun sank into a cold gray cloud in the west. The
bite of the wind grew sharper. The hoarse cough of a
child echoed from the cave behind him, and the dull crooning
song of the mother, as she tried to warm the sick child
at her breast, could be heard as the wind was lulled for a
moment.</p>

<p>Colder and more cold it grew, but Ang would not enter
the cave. He could not bear to hear the troubled breathing
of the child or see the face of the mother. He dreaded the
coming of the grim White Spirit for this, his last child.
Sometimes he fancied he could hear him rushing through
the woods above the cliff, and feel the chill of his breath on
his face. Had he no other food but children, this dread
hunter?</p>

<p>Colder and more cold it grew, but Ang still lingered. He
piled dry moss about his feet and tried to bring warmth to
his numb hands by hammering off flakes of flint which he
would later shape into rough weapons and tools. He struck
two flints together in a kind of dumb fury. It was a glancing
blow, and one of the flints dropped into the dry moss at
his feet with a flicker of sparks. A coil of gray smoke crept
out of the moss like a serpent coming out of his hole. A
bright spot at its heart grew brighter and brighter, and
then red flames lapped hungrily.</p>

<p>Ang leaped to his feet in astonishment. At the smiting
of the flint the Fire Spirit had been born. Its breath was
the breath of summer. He stretched out his hands over
the flames, and the cold loosened its grip. He touched the
flame, and it stung him like an angry bee. Clearly the
Spirit must not be handled. Awe and wonder filled the
mind of Ang. He fell on his knees and prayed to the Fire
Spirit: "Spirit of light and heat, Thou hast come in our
hour of need&mdash;I know not whence. Stay and keep away
the terrible cold Spirit with thy red arrows. Stay! I will
deny thee nothing. If Thou art hungry, I will feed thee."</p>

   <img src="images/illus277.png" alt="The Fire Spirit" title="The Fire Spirit" />
</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">The Fire Spirit</span></p>

<p>As Ang watched the fire, it hungrily ate up the dry moss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and lapped the dry sticks. He brought more and fed them
to the reaching flames. The northern darkness had shut
in the rest of the world, light lingered at the door of the
cave of Ang, and the warm breath of the fire brought back
the heat of summer in the midst of winter. Joy filled the
heart of Ang, and he called to the mother and the child:
"Oma, Om, come! The Great One has heard. Come,
come, come quickly."</p>

<p>The bark door opened, and the mother came out holding
the child to her breast. A cry of wonder broke from her as
she saw the fire, but wonder gave way to the mother instinct.
The All-Father had heard. Here were warmth and
light. The gray huntsman should not have her child. She
crouched by the fire, holding the babe in her arms so that
she sheltered it from the encircling cold while the glowing
fire warmed and healed it. With gratitude and awe she
watched the color come back to the child's face, and then
she looked with eager questioning at the face of Ang, as
it shone with a light brighter than that of the fire.</p>

<p>Finally he spoke: "I sat at the going in of the cave.
Fear gripped me; the cold smote me. I said, Odin has
forgotten. It may be that he has gone to the Southland
because the cold was stronger than he. I heard the barking
of the child. The dread of the great robber was on me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
I tried to forget. I smote the flints together. Star-flies
seemed to leap from the stone, and the fire was born in the
heart of the moss."</p>

<p>Then Ang stood by the mother and the child and placed
his left hand on the head of the mother and raised his
right hand to the sky to which the leaping flames pointed
and said: "Great Father, now I know that none is greater
than Thou; not even the giants of the North. Thy shining
arrows have driven the huntsman back. And I know that
Thine eyes see farther than the eagle floating in the sky,
for thou hast seen us alone in the great woods, and Thine
ear is quicker to hear than that of the mother listening for
the cry of her first-born, for thou hast heard the cry that
did not rise to our lips. Henceforth the fire shall be the
sign of Thee. As the flames leap up the sky, so shall our
thoughts leap to Thee, Our Father."</p>

<p>All through the long cold winter Ang and Oma fed the
fire, and Om grew well and strong again. They very soon
found that the fire, though it gave so freely the life-giving
light and heat, had to be treated with great care. It was a
good servant but a poor master. One day little Om toddled
too close and burned his hand on a live coal. On another
day the wind blew the sparks from the fire into the dry
rushes which screened the entrance to the cave, and in a
moment the cave was filled with flames and smoke, and
Oma had to cover her head and that of Om with skins, and
dash out into the open. All the bedding of dry leaves was
burned up, and some of the skins were badly scorched.
The wooden handles of many of Ang's spears and arrows
and knives were burned also. It took many days of hard
work to replace what the fire had eaten. So they came to
fear as well as to love it.</p>

<p>But Ang and Oma learned one thing from the fire which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
burned out their cave that was worth more than a thousand
fires could destroy. Part of a deer, which Ang had killed,
hung inside of the cave. It had been very hard to get, and
it was almost the first thing which Ang thought of after
the fire had burned down. If that had been destroyed,
they might starve before he could kill another one. He
dashed into the cave to see if anything was left, the fear of
hunger already gripping his vitals. A strange new odor
filled his nostrils and doubled his hunger&mdash;the smell of
roasted venison. The deer still hung from the side of the
cave. The hair had been burned off and the skin hung in
rolls, but the flesh was there, brown, hot, dripping red.</p>

<p>At Ang's call Oma hurried in. It needed but one whiff of
the fragrant air to convince her that the touch of fire had
made of the cold frozen meat food more delicious than the
fruits of summer. She snatched a long stone knife from
her belt and cut strips of venison steak from the smoking
mass and gave to Ang and Om.</p>

<p>After they had eaten, Ang looked into the glowing embers
of the fire in front of the cave and pondered. The Fire
Spirit had grown angry because they had taken only one of
the gifts of the Great Father and had burned out the cave,
but it had showed them what its magic touch would do to
the frozen meat. The wonder of it grew on him. As he
looked into the world at the heart of the coals, he saw the
promise of a better one than that in which he lived&mdash;a
world in which the sons of his son's sons should have discovered
all the gifts of the Fire Spirit.</p>

<p>As Ang looked into the fire, Oma looked into the face of
Ang and wondered at what she saw there. His look seemed
to pierce the blackness behind the fire a hundred days'
journey. "Father of my son, what seest thou in the fire?"
"I see," said Ang, "the spirits of the things which are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
be. I see, but do not understand all that I see. I see our
son's sons talking fire, the flames leaping from their mouths
like tongues; I see them crossing the Big Water in great
logs which breathe out fire and smoke. I see&mdash;but there
are no words to tell thee all that I see."</p>

<p>And Oma looked into the embers, and she too saw the
flickering spirits of the things to be. She saw countless
fires&mdash;fires in the woods, fires in caves, fires on altars&mdash;but
those who tended the fires were the daughters of her
daughters.</p>

<p>In a few days the damage done by the fire was repaired.
It was Oma who discovered that water stopped the hunger
of the fire, and when it grew too fierce she beat it back with
boughs dipped in the stream which ran before their cave.</p>

<p>The warmth of the fire and the cooked meat made little
Om grow as no boy had ever grown in the cold season, and
before the winter was over he was running about as sturdily
as a young bear. But it made trouble for Oma. The
woods were full of savage wild beasts, bears, panthers, and
wolves. Even Ang, with his strength and cunning and
great stone axe and sharp knives, was in constant danger.
When he went out to hunt, Oma always feared till he came
back. What chance then would little Om have? So she
tried to keep him always in the clearing before the cave,
but the task grew harder and harder as the weather grew
warmer and Om's legs stronger and his eyes more curious.</p>

<p>One evening, just as the dark was shutting in, Oma was
cracking some bones to get some choice marrow for Ang's
supper after he returned from his hunting, and for a moment
her back was turned to the boy. When she looked for him
he had slipped away into the darkness. The cry of a
hyena broke on the stillness of the night, savage, blood-curdling.
Then came a terrified scream from little Om.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
She leaped to her feet in terror. Where? Where? Which
way? The sound seemed to come from all directions.
Not knowing what she did, she snatched a burning brand
from the fire and dashed into the darkness, leaving a trail
of flame behind her.</p>

<p>She had gone only a few yards when she came upon the
beast crouching over little Om. Thoughtless of all danger
to herself, Oma leaped at the savage beast, whirling the
burning brand about her head. The hyena gave a snarl of
surprise and fear, dropped Om, and sprang away into the
thicket, with leaps longer than any he had made in his
life, for the fear of the fire was on him.</p>

<p>Oma snatched her baby to her breast and hurried back
to the cave, crooning over him as she went. She brought
him to the fire and stripped off his little fur coat; that was
in shreds, but the child's skin was only slightly scratched.</p>

<p>As she locked him in her arms to comfort him, Ang
suddenly leaped out of the darkness, his great stone axe
swinging in his hands. Terror was in his face; sweat
dropped from him like rain. "The hyena! I heard his
cry here and that of little Om!"</p>

<p>Oma pointed to the baby in her arms, to the torn skin
at her feet, to the smoldering branch and to the darkness
which had swallowed the great beast. "It was only a moment,
but he slipped away into the darkness; I heard the
cry, the cry of the beast and the cry of the child. I caught
up a brand from the fire and ran; the fearless one ran at the
sight of it. The child is safe, see!" And Om looked at
his father through tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>Then Ang knelt by the side of the child and its mother
and prayed: "O Thou who are greater than the greatest
and mightier than the mightiest, again Thou hast saved us
by the red magic. By it Thou hast made us, Thy children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
masters of the beasts of the wood, for the fear of the Red
One is upon them all."</p>

<p>As the strength of the winter passed and the snow began
to melt, Ang had a visit from Wang, who lived some days'
journey to the east. During the winter the men of the
North saw little of each other. Each family needed a large
hunting ground, and men had not learned to live together.
The distances between the families were so great that when
the snow was deep in the woods months passed in which
the isolated families saw no human beings outside of their
own circle. But when the ice broke up and the snow melted,
the men who were on fairly friendly terms paid visits to each
other and exchanged stories of the winter's experiences.</p>

<p>Now Wang approached the cave of Ang with great ceremony.
It was neither good manners nor safe to approach
another man's home too suddenly. One could not be sure
of a welcome, and it was always assumed that one who
came suddenly was an enemy. So Wang strolled out on
an open spot by the bank of the river which flowed by the
cave of Ang, and acted as if he did not know that there was
another human being within a day's journey. He tossed
stones into the water and watched the ripples. Then he
imitated the call of the wild fowl on the river banks.</p>

<p>For a time Ang ignored him, going about as if he saw no
one. But Oma and Om peered out curiously from the
mouth of the cave. At last Ang wandered down to the
river's edge and looked aimlessly everywhere but where
Wang stood. He too tossed many stones into the river.
Finally, apparently satisfied that all the demands of primitive
etiquette had been met, Ang turned to Wang and put
his left hand over his heart and raised his right to the sky.
Wang did the same; they were of one blood and children
of the Great Father.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>Both dropped their weapons where they stood and went
to meet each other unarmed. Ang and Wang had played
together as boys, hunted together as young men, and taken
wives from the same family, but each spring, after the
winter's separation, they met with the same elaborate ceremony,
because it was the man custom.</p>

<p>When the men were seated, Oma and Om came out and
sat near by. "A long winter," said Ang. "A long winter,"
answered Wang. "Much cold," said Ang. "Much cold,"
answered Wang. "The woman and the boy?" asked Wang.
"The woman is well, and the child grows like a bear's cub,"
replied Ang.</p>

<p>Wang turned and looked at Oma and Om and gave a
grunt of surprise. "Why, they are as fat and sleek as if it
was the time of fruits and nuts instead of the end of the
great cold, when even the bear is so thin that he casts no
shadow. Has the eagle carried thee to the Southland on
its wings? Have you found food that cold does not harden?
Has Odin fed you? My woman sits all day at the going in
of the cave. She looks old like the moss-bearded oak.
She notices nothing, but talks ever about the little one
whom the Black Robber took; she cares not for the child
that is left, who cries for food like a young kid whose
mother the wolves have eaten. And my strength has not
come again. My traps and snares take nothing, and my
arrow is slower than the flying deer."</p>

<p>At this Oma leaped to her feet and brought a piece of
dried venison from the cave and a cake made from a flour
of pounded nuts and seeds and put them before the hungry
man. He ate ravenously, like a famished wolf, in silence,
but questioning with eager eye, "How? Why? What?"</p>

<p>And Ang answered the unspoken question: "It was
cold, so cold that the blood in one's body ran slow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
became like ice in the stream. The meat became like stone.
The supply of nuts failed. The woman grew weak. The
huntsman from the north took the child by the throat.
His breath came hard. I said, 'He will be taken as the
others have been taken, and the mother will not stay without
the child, and I shall be alone,' and I cried to the Great
One, to Odin, the All-Father: 'We are cold, give us heat;
we are hungry, give us food.' I heard no answer; there
was no voice; but the prayer was heard. I sat by the
going in of the cave, making knives of flint, not thinking to
use them, but hoping to forget and cover up the hoarse
crying of the child with the noise of the flints. So I smote
two stones together, and the chips fell into the dry moss at
my feet. There was a buzzing noise like that of a bee in a
flower; a little white cloud rose from the moss, then spots
of light like star-flies at night. Red tongues reached out
and ate up the moss and the dry sticks. I saw that the
Red One was hungry, and I gave him more moss and dry
wood to eat. He grew big and bright, and his breath was
warm like that of summer, and Oma brought out the child,
and he drove away the barking sickness from the child's
throat. Then we knew that Odin had heard us."</p>

<p>And Ang told Wang how they had learned to cook the
venison; how they had learned to feed the Red One and
keep him from wandering. He told how the fear of him
was on all the beasts of the woods, so that not even the
most savage and the most hungry dared stand before him;
and the smallest child was safe within the circle of light.</p>

<p>Then they took the wondering Wang and showed him the
sacred fire, gift of the Keeper of Secrets; they cooked venison
over the coals so that he might taste it. And when
Wang started for home Oma gave him a shoulder of smoked
deer's meat and cakes made of acorn meal.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>And now a strange thing happened. Pity stirred the
heart of Ang. Odin had helped him in the time of his
troubles; why should he not help Wang? He turned to
Oma. "The hunting is good; the stream is full of fish;
the Red One can warm more than three. I will go and
bring Wang and his woman and his child. They can live
in the cave which we thought should be Om's. It is the
will of the All-Father that men should live together."</p>

<p>And the men went together and brought Wang's wife
and child, and they made a screen and bark door for the
new cave home. Oma taught Suta, wife of Wang, the
mysteries of the fire, and Ang and Wang became the first
neighbors, and that also was one of the gifts of the Revealer,
through the Spirit of the Fire.</p>

<p>As time went on, the story of Ang, the fire-man, spread
through all the north country, and often men came as Wang
had done, many day's journey, through trackless forest, to
see the wonderful fire in front of the cave of Ang. But
Ang told to no one but Wang the secret of how to call the
Fire Spirit. To men who were friendly he gave live coals
to carry away in bowls hollowed out of soapstone. Men
who were the enemies of Ang did not dare come near his
cave for fear of the red knives which guarded it.</p>

<p>By and by men began to say to each other, as they went
to hunt or sat about the carefully tended fire, that Ang, the
fire-man, must be loved by Odin, and they came to Ang
and said: "Tell us of the Great One," and Ang was troubled
because he had not heard his voice or seen him. As he
hunted in the stillness of the forest, he pondered: "Why
had no one ever seen the Great Spirit? Or was the sky his
face and the sun and moon his eyes? Why had no one
heard his voice? Or was the thunder his voice? If so, no
one understood his language." The more he thought, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
more troubled he became. For days at a time he rarely
spoke and went about as one in a dream, and Oma said to
Wang and to others who came, "The spell of Odin is on
him," and they began to look on Ang with awe and wonder.</p>

<p>One night as Ang was far from home and slept in a cave
on a hill-side, he dreamed that his shadow self left his body
and journeyed to a far country, and there he saw his father
and his father's father and the men of long ago. They
all sat about a great fire and beckoned to him to join their
circle. There was a silence like that before the storm,
and each one in the circle looked steadfastly into the fire,
which burned on and on, though no one fed its flames.</p>

<p>As Ang continued to look into the flames, it seemed as if
something was lifted from his eyes and he saw what no one
had seen before. The earth was the body of Odin. His
life was the life of all. He had not one voice like man, but
many. He spoke in the thunder, in the voice of the storm,
but also in the song of the birds and in the words of one's
best beloved.</p>

<p>Ang awoke just as the sun was driving the mists from the
valley beneath him, and these words came to his lips as if
they were a message from the dream-world which he had
just left: "The wise son of the All-Father sees him everywhere
and hears his voice always." For the first time in
his life Ang saw the beauty of the world at his feet, and the
song of the birds which filled the vibrant air awoke a new
joy of melody and harmony in his soul.</p>

<p>As Oma and Om came out to meet him, he looked at
them with newly opened eyes. How beautiful was the
ruddy brown sheen of Oma's hair and the light in her
eyes as she welcomed him! And little Om's eyes sparkled
like dewdrops in the light of early morning, and his laughter
was like the splashing of a brook over its pebbles.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>When Ang told Oma of his dream, she answered: "The
men were right. The spell of the Keeper of Secrets was on
thee. Thou art a man apart. Henceforth thou shalt tell
men the will of the One who hides himself."</p>

<p>And so Ang became one of the voices of Odin. From far
and near men in trouble and men in doubt came to him,
and he spoke words of comfort and wisdom. And every
year before the cold kept men apart they gathered at the
home of Ang. They built a great stone altar, and each
man threw a log upon the fire which Ang had kindled.
And they brought the choicest from their hunting and had
a great feast, but they always gave the best to Ang, and he
put it in the fire, saying, "The best we have is Thine and
we are Thine." And when they had feasted and were
satisfied, Ang talked to them of the All-Father, and each
year his words were wiser and more winning.</p>

<p>Before the men departed each took a brand from the
fire and marched about the altar chanting:</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOYHOOD_OF_A_PAINTER" id="THE_BOYHOOD_OF_A_PAINTER">THE BOYHOOD OF A PAINTER</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries there took
place, first in Italy and afterwards in the other countries of
Europe, a great change known in history as the Renaissance.
The long word simply means "rebirth", and the name was
given to this period because then all the interest in art and
literature and music and beauty of every kind, which had
seemed for centuries to be dead, came to life again. Painters
and poets and musicians began to fill the world with their
songs and their pictures. You are going to read now the
story of one of the most famous of the painters of the fifteenth
century in Italy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Leonardo da Vinci, the great painter, was the son of a
lawyer in the beautiful city of Florence. Even as a tiny
child he began to show what profession he was likely to
follow, for as soon as he could crawl, he would scramble
away when his mother was not looking, to a place in the
garden where after a shower there was always a pile of
mud. He would sit happily on the ground pinching the
mud into some sort of shape, and the older he grew the
more the shape became like that of some object that he
knew. When his mother missed him and came in search
of him, the baby would scream in disgust, and the only
way to quiet him was to play on the lute, an instrument
very much like our mandolin.</p>

<p>Ser Piero, Leonardo's father, was very proud of his astonishing
little son, and resolved that he must have the
very best teachers that could be found. So the boy was
still very young when his lessons began. Lessons were no
trouble to him, for he quite took away the breath of all his
teachers by his amazing quickness, no matter whether the
work was arithmetic, or languages, or music. Whatever
he heard once he understood and remembered.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever lessons he might be doing, however, Leonardo
spent his spare time in drawing and in modelling figures in
clay. His father decided that this was the talent which the
boy ought specially to make use of. So he took his son to
his friend the sculptor Verocchio. When they reached the
studio, Leonardo was given some clay and told to model
anything he liked. He sat down on the floor, and soon
finished a tiny statuette which was so lifelike that it might
have been the work of the sculptor himself. Verocchio
was delighted, and declared that he must have this boy as
a pupil at once.</p>

<p>As Leonardo grew older, he began to outstrip his master
in the art of painting, though not in that of sculpture. At
one time, it is said, Verocchio was working on a picture of
the baptism of Jesus by John, in which an angel was represented
as standing at one side. He entrusted the painting
of this angel to his pupil. When the master came to look
at the finished figure, he stood gazing in astonished silence.
He was too true an artist not to feel that he and Leonardo
had changed places, and that the boy's painting of the
angel was worth all the rest of the picture. The story goes
that Verocchio was so impressed by the feeling that he
could only do badly what Leonardo could do perfectly that
he never painted again.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting tales of the artist's boyhood
tells of his painting of a shield. His father, Ser Piero, had
gone to his country house outside of Florence. One evening
a farmer of the neighborhood was brought to him as he
sat in the garden, asking that he might speak with Ser
Piero. He knew the farmer well, for they had often gone
fishing together. "Well, what now, Francisco?" he asked,
as the farmer came up bowing and bearing in his hands a
wooden shield. Francisco explained that he had cut down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
a fig tree near his house, as it was too old to bear fruit, and
that he had cut out of its wood the shield he was carrying.
He had brought it to Ser Piero, hoping that the master
would have the goodness to get it painted with some design,
for he wished to hang it up in his kitchen as a remembrance
of the old tree.</p>

<p>So when Ser Piero next went to Florence he took the
shield to his son, not telling him to whom it belonged, but
merely asking him to paint something on it. Leonardo,
examining the piece of wood, found that it was rough and
ill made, and that it would need much finishing before it
would be possible to paint on it. So he held it before the
fire till the fibres were softened and the crookedness straightened
out, and then he planed and polished it. When it was
all ready, he began to think about what the picture on it
should be. A look of mischief came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"I know!" he said to himself. "A shield ought to have
on it some frightful thing, so that the very sight of it may
make the enemies of its wearer tremble. The person who
sees this shield shall be as frightened as if he beheld the
head of Medusa; only instead of being turned to stone,
he will most likely run away." You see, he did not
know that the shield was to adorn the home of a simple
farmer.</p>

<p>Smiling to himself, Leonardo went out into the fields and
hunted about until he had collected a large number of
strange creatures, hedgehogs, lizards, locusts, snakes, and
many others. These he carried home and locked up in the
room he used for a workshop, where no one was allowed to
enter but himself. Using the ugly things as models, he
began to paint on the shield a monster formed out of all
the creatures, with eyes and legs everywhere. It was a
long time before he succeeded in making anything frightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
enough to suit him. Again and again he erased his work
and did it over, trying to combine his creatures differently.
But at last something so terrible stared him in the face
that he almost felt frightened himself.</p>

<p>"The monster is ready," he said with a laugh; "but I
must find a background fitting for him."</p>

<p>So he painted as a background a black and narrow cavern,
at whose mouth stood the shapeless creature he had made,
all eyes, all legs, all savage jaws. Flames poured from it
on every side, and a cloud of vapor rose upwards from its
many nostrils. After days of hard work, Leonardo at last
went to his father and told him he had finished the shield,
which he hoped would please its owner. Ser Piero came
at once, and was led into the partly darkened studio, where
in just the right light the shield stood on an easel. But no
sooner was the father within the room than he turned to
fly, so terrible was the object that met his gaze.</p>

<p>"It will do, I see," said Leonardo. "I wanted to make
something so dreadful that everyone would shiver with
fear at the sight of it. Take it away with you now; but I
had better wrap it up, or you will frighten people out of
their wits as you go along."</p>

<p>Ser Piero took the shield and went away without telling
his son anything about old Francisco. But he was quite
sure that the farmer would not like the picture, and that it
was not at all suitable to hang in a farmhouse kitchen;
and more than that, he felt it was far too wonderful a painting
to fall into the hands of a peasant and never be famous.
So in order to save the old man's feelings, he went to a
shop and bought a shield of the same size as the first one,
which had on it a device of a heart pierced by an arrow;
and the next time he went to the country he sent for Francisco
to come and get it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, your Excellency, how beautiful!" cried the old man
in delight, as he received his shield after his long waiting.</p>

<p>"I thought you would be pleased," answered Ser Piero,
thinking to himself how frightened rather than pleased the
farmer would have been with Leonardo's monster.</p>

<blockquote><p>All should begin reading at the same moment. Can you after
one minute give a good account of the meaning of <i>civil death</i>?</p></blockquote>

<p>According to law a person may be alive and enjoying
good health and still under certain conditions be dead to
all his civil rights. In some states, as New York, this is
true of one sentenced to the state prison for life; all his
civil rights are taken from him and to the world he is as
dead. In all states, absence for a specified time without
any knowledge of the whereabouts of the individual renders
him legally dead to his civil rights; this period is in most
states seven years. Supposing A, living in Wisconsin,
should leave his home and family and go to Alaska. If at
the end of seven years no word had been received from
him, the law assumes him to be dead; his estate can be
settled by probate, provided the family consents, and his
wife may legally marry again. Should he afterwards return
he could not compel the court to restore his estate or
family; these are legally forfeited, beyond all redress.</p>

North&mdash;Alaska or northern Canada, or even the northern
United States&mdash;with the brave, rough men who live about
mining or lumber camps or trading posts. In many of the

<p>When white men first came to America, they thought it
was a country called India of which they had often heard.
So they called the people they found here Indians. They
also called them red men, because they were about the
color of a copper cent that has been carried a while. These
red men did not have many tools and other things to make
it easy to work and to live. They had no horses, cows,
pigs, sheep or chickens, so they had to catch wild animals
for food. They had no guns nor rifles, but made spears
and bows and arrows with which to kill their game. They
had no iron. Their arrow points and spear heads were of
sharpened stone, as was a heavy tool they made something
like our hatchet. It was a very dull, poor hatchet. They
had no cloth to make clothes. Instead, they used the skins
of wild animals they caught or shot with their bows and
arrows. Instead of houses they had tents or wigwams
made of skins. The Indians thought the white men's
things were wonderful, and they were much pleased to
trade furs and game for blankets, guns, powder, and bullets.
The Indians like bright, pretty things, so they were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
fond of trading for beads to make necklaces and ornaments
for their suits.</p>

<p>After a long time, the white men took most of the Indians'
country, but there is still a large part of North America
where there are more Indians than white men. This is
far to the north in Canada, in a wide strip between the
towns and farms of the white men and the cold, snow land
of the Eskimos. The soldiers who have been to the Great
War tell us much about England, France, and Germany;
but the country where the Indians still have their hunting
grounds is larger than all of these countries put together.
The region is covered with evergreen forests, a great silent
land of deep snow and trees and cold. It is too cold and
rocky for the white man to make farms, so he has not cut
down the trees. There are no cities nor houses, nothing but
forests where the Indian hunts game and lives in his tent
as he has always lived.</p>

<p>To trade with these Indians, the white men have built
stores in the edge of the Indian country. They are called
Posts&mdash;Trading Posts. When the warm days of June
come and the ice is all melted, the keeper of a Post begins
to look up the river watching for canoes to come around the
bend. At last he sees one. In front sits an Indian woman
paddling, and in the stern of the canoe sits Otelne, her
husband, paddling and also steering. They are coming to
the post to trade. In the middle of the boat are a boy,
a girl, a brand new baby, and a dog. The boy's name is
Akusk (arrow); the girl's name is Wabogum (flower).
The baby's name is Wabshish (little white hare). He is
tied to a board to keep him safe and warm. The canoe
contains one more thing, very precious, a big bundle of
fur skins. This is the wages of a whole year, the result
of a hard winter's work in the forest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>The keeper of the Post shakes hands with Otelne.
Otelne opens the bale of furs, and the first afternoon he
and his wife trade a few muskrat skins for some flour, beans,
bacon and canned peaches. Then the Indians camp and
have a feast. Other canoes come down the river bringing
other families until the post becomes a great picnic ground.
They talk over the happenings of the winter, of getting
lost in storms, of upsetting their canoes, of falling through
the ice, of the bears they have caught, and the wolves that
have chased them. They wonder what has happened to
the Indians who do not come back. They have canoe races
and the different families, or tribes, play match games of
la crosse. This game, which the white men learned from
the Indians, is now the national game of Canada, as baseball
is of the United States.</p>

<p>In August the trading is over, and the Indians start back
to the hunting grounds for another year's work. The
canoe is loaded full. Instead of the bale of furs, Otelne
has in his canoe a new tent, a sheet-iron stove, some stove
pipe, twenty-five steel traps, a rifle, one thousand cartridges,
fish hooks and fishing line, a wood saw, knives, axes,
buckets, blankets, and a lot of white men's clothes. He
did not buy any shoes because he would rather have the
moccasins he makes himself.</p>

<p>It is hard work to paddle the heavy load up the river
against the swift current. Presently they hear the roaring
noise of a waterfall where the stream jumps down over
some rocks. The canoe cannot pass this, so they all get
out and carry the canoe and all its load, bit by bit, along a
little path that leads to the quiet water above the falls.
Here they load the canoe again and paddle on, but they
soon come to another carrying place, or portage as it is
called, and have to unload again. They are not afraid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
leave their belongings while they go back to the foot of
the falls, for no Indian would think of stealing anything
he found in this way.</p>

<p>You can see why the Indians do not use white men's
boats, for no white man's boat is as light as the birch bark
canoe. You can also see why they do not take much food
from the post. They cannot carry it and all they need for
camping and hunting too. They must have the tent and
traps, so they take only food enough to last until they get
far enough from the post to find game.</p>

<p>After a few days' journey they leave the main stream and
go up one of its branches. Here they come to a place
where the stream widens into a lake. The water is very
still, and as the fishing is good, the Indians camp here for a
week and rest. There are so many wolves and wild cats
in the woods that Otelne puts up the tent on a little island
out in the middle of the lake.</p>

<p>For many days they go on upstream. Over and over again
they have to carry their goods around rapids. The dark
branches of spruce, hemlock, and fir trees often hang over
the stream.</p>

<p>Trout, pickerel, and other fish dart in behind the rocks
around which the currents flow. Sometimes a muskrat,
a beaver, or an otter swims quickly into his hole in the bank.
But sometimes the rifle is too quick for him and the Indians
have fresh meat for supper. Each day they pass the mouths
of little streams and the main stream gets smaller and
smaller, till at last it is hardly more than a brook.</p>

<p>They are busy nearly all the time carrying their supplies
around rapids. At last they can go no farther in the
canoe because the stream has grown too small and rocky.
To go still farther in their direction, the Indians must find
a stream which flows the opposite way. To find this stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
they must cross a hill, because, you see, the water will
run down the hill on the other side, gathering more and
more water, and getting larger as it goes. This water
parting is called a divide, or watershed. There is such a
divide at the top of every mountain range. For instance,
all the rivers flowing east of the Alleghany Mountains run
east to the Atlantic Ocean; all those flowing west run
finally into the Mississippi River. So the Alleghany
Mountains are a divide.</p>

<p>Otelne knows of one place where the streams bend in
such a way that he can, in an hour, carry his canoe from
canoe-water on one stream to canoe-water on the stream
over the hill. The Indians know where these good portages
are just as country boys know where they can catch rabbits,
or as city boys know where they can find a place to play.
For many days, Otelne steers his canoe down stream,
camping on the bank each night.</p>

<p>In late October the first snow falls. They camp beside
the lonely river, and the fur hunting begins in earnest.
Otelne fixes a round of traps. He starts away from his
tent and makes a large circle in the forest, fixing a round
of traps as he goes. When he cannot see the sun, he keeps
his direction through the forest by noticing the moss which
grows only on the shady side of a tree trunk. He can keep his
direction at night, too, if he can see the stars, for long before
white men came, Indians had noticed that one star always
seemed to be in the same place. They call it the "Great
Star". We call it the "North Star". The pointers in the
Great Dipper show us where it is. Otelne watches them
every clear night.</p>

<p>Twenty miles he travels, setting his traps wherever he
sees in the snow the tracks of the animals he wants. He
drags sweet-smelling meat along the snow, hoping that
animals crossing this trail will follow it to the traps. After
a day or two, he goes around again, putting fresh bait on
his traps and taking out the animals he has caught. After
several rounds, he finds that game is getting scarce here,
so he and his wife put the tent and all their things on two
toboggans (sleds), tuck the baby down in the blankets,
and trudge all day through the forest. When night comes
they put up the tent on the snow, cut evergreen boughs to
make a thick carpet, and build a fire in the sheet-iron stove.
All winter long they move every two or three weeks, finding
a new camp whenever a new hunting-ground is necessary.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Otelne Walks on Snow Shoes.</span></p>

<p>Can you see Otelne as he visits his traps? He walks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
on snow shoes to keep from sinking into the snow which
is now three feet deep. His big dog pulls a toboggan on
which is an axe, a package of raw smoked meat in a little
box of birch bark, and a roll of blankets. Akusk, the twelve-year-old
boy, goes with his father, from whom he learns
all the Indian arts and the ways of the animals in the forest.
It is all the schooling he ever gets. How would you like
to get your schooling that way?</p>

<p>The first trap is empty and the bait gone, so Otelne puts
fresh bait in it. The second trap holds a fine mink, dead
and frozen stiff. His skin is worth ten dollars. The fifth
trap has in it the foot of a muskrat and some scraps of fur
lying around. Some hungry animal has raided the trap,
and the big dog, Wagush, smells the trail, whines, and
jumps about so that he upsets the sled. Otelne turns him
loose, and away he goes yelping through the forest, until
at last his regular baying tells Otelne that he has treed the
animal. It is a lynx. The rifle brings him down and he is
placed on the sled along with the mink.</p>

<p>At nightfall, ten miles from the tent, they come to a
shelter made of boughs. When Otelne set the traps, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
built this shelter to keep off the cold wind, for he knew he
would have to sleep here on bitter cold nights. He builds
a roaring fire in front of the shelter. They eat the mink,
give the scraps and bones to Wagush, wrap up in rabbit-skin
blankets, and lie down with their heads toward the
shelter, their feet toward the fire, and the dog beside them.
Two hours later Wagush wakes them with a growl. Two
wolves are prowling around in the spruce trees, but wolves
fear fire, so Otelne throws on more wood and they slink
away. At dawn the Indians are up and on their way to
the rest of the traps.</p>

<p>They kill a bear. This is great luck, for now they have
meat enough to last for weeks. Even with the help of
Akusk and Wagush, Otelne has hard work to drag that
bear on the toboggan six miles back to the tent. All three
are so weary they have to rest all the next day. Sulian,
the mother, who skins the animals, takes care of the skins
and smokes the meat. That is her part of the work.
You may be sure that the children are glad to see their
father and brother come back, for there isn't another
family within twenty miles, nor is there one white man
within a hundred miles.</p>

<p>Day after day, through the long, cold winter, Otelne
and his family hunt the fur that they can trade for the white
man's tools and supplies. When the trapping season ends,
Otelne is four hundred miles from the post, and it takes
many weeks of canoeing to get back there for summer
trading. They carry with them a bundle of smoked meat
to eat where game or fish cannot be found.</p>

<p>Each year Indian families go out for furs and never
come back. The canoe may upset and swift water carry
away all their things. Sometimes they get lost and freeze
to death in terrible blizzards. The hunting may be bad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
so they starve. The father may be drowned or break
his leg and freeze to death away out in the forest. Then
the mother cannot get enough game to keep the children
alive, so they all starve and the wolves eat them. The fur
gatherer has a hard, cold life in the far North, but it is
better than it used to be before he traded with the white man
and got guns, knives, traps, and fish hooks.</p>

<p>When all goes well with the fur gatherer, the boys and
girls in the little tent play many games. They are fond of
checkers. To make a checker-board, they split a piece of
wood out of a log, smooth one side of it with an axe, mark
it into squares with a knife, and blacken some of them
with charcoal. For men, they saw off short pieces of a
stick as thick as your thumb. Jackstraws is another favorite
game, but the straws are tiny canoe paddles, knives, guns,
snowshoes, snow shovels, and canoes, all whittled out of
wood, making a queer looking pile. They have one campfire
game in which they shake up eight disks of bone in a
bowl. This game is so hard to learn that my friend, Professor
Speck, spent three days learning it, and the rules
for counting the score would fill three pages of a book like
this one. This game, so hard to learn, shows that the
Indian would be as smart as the white man if he had a
chance to learn the same things. White men who hunt
with the Indians like them and say they are good companions.</p>

<p>The white men from the trading posts bring the furs
down to our great cities, where they are made into mittens
and muffs and coats and ladies' furs, and the next winter,
while the Indian is back in the forest following his traps,
we can see people wearing the furs in almost any part of
the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="VERDUN_BELLE" id="VERDUN_BELLE">"VERDUN BELLE"</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>This is the story of Verdun Belle, a trench dog, who adopted
a young leatherneck, followed him to the edge of the battle
around Chateau-Thierry and was waiting for him when they
carried him out. It is a true story.</p></blockquote>

<p>Belle was a setter, shabby white, with great splotches
of chocolate brown in her coat. Her ears were brown and
silken. She was under size and would not have stood a
chance among the haughtier breeds shown in splendor at
dog shows in Madison Square Garden. But the marines
in the regiment to which she attached herself thought
there never was a dog like her since the world began.</p>

<p>No one in the regiment knew whence she came or why.
When she joined the outfit in a <i>sector</i> near Verdun, she
singled out one of the privates as her very own and attached
herself to him for the duration of the war. The young
marine would talk long and earnestly to her, and every one
declared that Belle could "<i>comprè</i>" English.</p>

<p>She used to curl up at his feet when he slept or follow
silently to keep him company at the <i>listening post</i>. She
would sit hopefully in front of him whenever he settled
down with his laden <i>mess kit</i>, which the cooks always
heaped extra high in honor of Belle.</p>

<p>Belle was as used to war as the most weather-beaten
French <i>poilu</i>. The tremble of the ground did not disturb
her and the whining whir of the shells overhead only made
her twitch and wrinkle her nose in her sleep. She was
trench-broken. You could have put a plate of savory
pork chops on the <i>parapet</i> and nothing would have induced
her to go after them.</p>

<p>She weathered many a gas attack. Her master contrived
a protection for her by cutting down and twisting a French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
gas mask. At first this sack over her nose irritated her
tremendously; but once, when she was trying to claw it
off with her forepaws, she got a whiff of the poisoned air.
Then a great light dawned on Belle; and after that, at the
first alarm, she would race for her mask. You could not
have taken it from her until her master's pat on her back
told her everything was all right.</p>

<p>In the middle of May, Belle presented a proud but not
particularly astonished regiment with nine confused and
wriggling puppies, black-and-white, or, like the mother,
brown-and-white, and possessed of immense appetites.
Seven of these were alive and kicking when the order came
for the regiment to pull up stakes and speed across France
to help stem the German tide north of the troubled Marne.</p>

<p>In the rush and hubbub of marching orders Belle and her
brood were forgotten by every one but the young marine.
It never once entered his head to leave her or her pups
behind. Somewhere he found a market basket and tumbled
the litter into that. He could carry the pups, he explained,
and the mother dog would trot at his heels.</p>

<p>Now the amount of hardware a marine is expected to
carry on the march is carefully calculated to the maximum
strength of the average soldier, yet this leatherneck found
extra muscle somewhere for his precious basket. If it
came to the worst, he thought, he could <i>jettison</i> his pack.
It was not very clear in his mind what he would do with his
charges during a battle, but he trusted to luck and Verdun
Belle.</p>

<p>For twenty-five miles he carried his burden along the
parched French highway. No one wanted to jeer him out
of it, nor could have if they would. When there followed
a long advance by <i>camion</i>, he yielded his place to the basket
of wriggling pups, while he himself hung on the tail-board.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was more hiking, and the basket proved too
much. It seemed that the battle line was somewhere far
off. Solemnly the young marine killed four of the puppies,
discarded the basket and slipped the other three into his
shirt. Thus he trudged on his way, carrying those three,
pouched in forest green, as a kangaroo carries its young,
while the mother dog trotted trustingly behind.</p>

<p>One night he found that one of the black-and-white
pups was dead. The road by this time was black with
hurrying troops, lumbering <i>lorries</i> jostling the line of advancing
ambulances, and dust-gray columns of soldiers
moving on as far ahead and as far behind as the eye could see.
Passing silently in the other direction was the desolate
procession of refugees from the invaded countryside.
Now and then a herd of cows or a little cluster of fugitives
from some desolated village, trundling their most cherished
possessions in wheelbarrows and baby carts, would cause
an eddy in the traffic.</p>

<p>Somewhere in this crowding and confusion Belle was lost.
In the morning there was no sign of her, and the young marine
did not know what to do. He begged a cup of milk from
an old French woman, and with the eye dropper from his
kit he tried to feed the two pups. It did not work well.
Faintly the wind brought down the valley from far ahead
the sound of cannon. Soon he would be in the thick of it,
and there was no Belle to care for the pups.</p>

<p>Two ambulances of a field hospital were passing in the
unending caravan. A lieutenant who looked human was
in the front seat of one of them, a sergeant beside him.
The <i>leatherneck</i> ran up to them, blurted out his story, gazed
at them imploringly and thrust the puppies into their hands.
"Take good care of them," he said; "I don't suppose I'll
ever see them again."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>And he was gone. A little later in the day that field
hospital was pitching its tents and setting up its kitchens
and tables in a deserted farm. Amid all the hurry of
preparation for the big job ahead they found time to worry
about those pups. The problem was food. <i>Corned willy</i>
was tried and found wanting. Finally the first sergeant
hunted up a farm-bred private, and the two of them spent
that evening chasing four nervous and distrustful cows
around a pasture trying vainly to capture enough milk to
provide supper for the new members of the hospital staff.</p>

<p>Next morning the problem was still unsolved. But it
was solved that evening. For that evening a fresh contingent
of marines trooped by the farm and in their wake,
tired, anxious, but undiscouraged, was Verdun Belle.
Six miles back two days before she had lost her master,
and until she should find him again she evidently had thought
that any marine was better than none.</p>

<p>The troops did not halt at the farm, but Belle did. At
the gate she stopped dead in her tracks, drew in her lolling
tongue, sniffed inquiringly at the evening air, and, like a
flash, a white streak along the drive, she raced to the distant
tree, where, on a pile of discarded dressings in the shade,
the pups were sleeping.</p>

<p>All the corps men stopped work and stood around and
marveled. For the onlooker it was such a family reunion
as warms the heart. For the worried mess sergeant it was
a great relief. For the pups it was a mess call, clear and
unmistakable.</p>

<p>So with renewed faith in her heart and only one worry
left in her mind, Verdun Belle and her puppies settled down
with this field hospital. When the next day the reach of
the artillery made it advisable to move down the valley
to the shelter of a fine hillside chateau, you may be sure
that room was made in the first ambulance for the <i>three</i>
wanderers.</p>

<p class="caption2"><span class="smcap">Two Cots Were Shoved Together Under a Spreading Tree</span></p>

<p>In a grove of trees beside the house the tents were pitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
and the cots of the expected patients ranged side by side.
The wounded came&mdash;came hour after hour in steady
streams, and the boys of the hospital worked on them
night and day. They could not possibly keep track of all
the cases, but there was one who did. Always a mistress
of the art of keeping out from under foot, very quietly
Belle hung around and investigated each ambulance that
turned in from the main road and backed up with its load
of pain to the door of the receiving room.</p>

<p>Then one evening they lifted out a young marine,
listless in the half stupor of shell shock. To the busy workers
he was just Case No. Such and Such, but there was no need
to tell any one who saw the wild rejoicing of the dog that
Belle had found her own at last.</p>

<p>The first consciousness her master had of his new surroundings
was the feel of her rough pink tongue licking the
dust from his face. And those who passed that way on
the following Sunday found two cots shoved together in
the kindly shade of a spreading tree. On one the mother
dog lay, contented with her puppies. Fast asleep on the
other, his arm thrown out so that one grimy hand could
touch one silken ear, lay the young marine. Before long
they would have to ship him on to the <i>evacuation hospital</i>,
on from there to the base hospital, on and on and on.
It was not very clear to anyone how another separation
could be prevented. It was a perplexing question, but
they knew in their hearts that they could safely leave the
answer to some one else. They could leave it to Verdun
Belle.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARADES" id="CHARADES">CHARADES</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Did you ever play charades? Here is a brief statement
about charades taken from a cyclopedia. See if you can read
it through in a half-minute so as to give the substance of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>A charade is a popular form of riddle, the answer to which
is a word of several syllables, each of which alone is in itself
a word. Each syllable, taken as a word, is described, and
finally a puzzling definition of the whole word is given.
The following is an example: "Some one threw my first
and second at me, and it hit my third. It did not hurt me,
for it was only a branch of my whole." The answer is
<i>Mistletoe</i>. A girl, sitting under a high table, would suggest
the word <i>misunderstand</i>.</p>

<p>A pleasing charade requiring more thought is in the form
of a rhyme, as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My first is a circle, my second a cross;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you meet with my whole, look out for a toss."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The answer is <i>Ox</i>. Then, too, charades are often presented
in the form of little plays, each syllable representing a
scene. They are then called <i>acting</i> charades. This form
of amusement is much in vogue on social occasions. It is
thought the name was derived from a French word meaning
<i>idle talk</i>, which in its turn was derived from Spanish
words meaning <i>speech and actions of a clown</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>More people, perhaps, read a newspaper every day
than read any other form of print. At the breakfast table,
in the trolley car, or in the railroad train, morning and
evening you see readers buried in their newspapers. Many
people read at least two papers a day, and many people
read very little else. But unfortunately a great many of
these people read the newspapers very hastily, and sometimes
they fail to grasp the real sense of the column beneath
the catchy headlines. They need practice in the rapid and
intelligent reading of a news article.</p>

<p>You may begin to have that sort of practice now, if you
will read rapidly the following newspaper account of the
homecoming, in September, 1919, of one of America's
greatest soldiers, and be able to answer the following
questions. Your teacher may ask each row of pupils to
be responsible for two or three of the questions.</p>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>New York, Sept. 8.&mdash;General John
J. Pershing, commander-in-chief of the
A. E. F., came home from France today
and was welcomed in a manner which
fully conveyed to him the gratitude and
pride with which the American people
estimate his services in leading the
nation's greatest army to victory in the
world's greatest war.</p>

<p>From early morning, when the sea
monster Leviathan arrived in the Hudson&mdash;a
shadowy giant in a misty sunrise&mdash;until
the middle of the afternoon,
when the general insisted upon an intermission
for a much-needed nap, he
was the central figure of a demonstration
which for brilliancy and gayety has
rarely been equaled in the history of
New York City.</p>
            </td>
            <td style="width:50%" align="left" valign="top">

<p>The presentation of his permanent
commission as a full general in the regular
army, accomplished by the secretary
of war ten minutes after the general
had stepped upon American soil,
while perhaps the most important
tribute, was merely an auspicious beginning
of what was to follow. A river
pageant on the Hudson from Hoboken
to the Battery, a triumphal march
through surging crowds on Broadway
and Fifth Avenue, exercises at the City
Hall, during which he was given the
freedom of the city for four days; a reception,
a luncheon, and in the evening
a dinner and a theatre party in his
honor&mdash;all this was part of the crowded
and colorful program. None was surprised,
therefore, when the distinguished
guest good-naturedly remarked
that if this continued long he would
"almost wish that the war had gone
on."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pleased To Be Back Home</span></p>

<p>The general accepted it all quietly
and simply. He was pleased to be home.
He could not conceal that, but neither
could he conceal the fact that he would
have preferred to come home without
so much fuss being stirred up about it.
He bowed, nodded, waved, or smiled
acknowledgment of the cheering. The
Pershing smile, incidentally, will without
doubt take its place among the famous
smiles of America. All great
Americans seem to have a characteristic
smile. There was the Roosevelt smile,
and there are the Taft and Wilson
smiles, and now there is the Pershing
smile, quite as striking as any of the
others. The people liked it immensely;
but more than that they liked the
brief responses made by the general to
the eulogies delivered by the secretary
of war, the governor of New York, and
the mayor of the city. He accepted all
of them&mdash;with a reservation, that reservation
being that he accepted them not
for himself but for the boys who went
over and fought and died for the flag.
It was this that convinced the people
that Pershing was truly a great man.</p>

<p>The Leviathan, bringing, besides General
Pershing, his picked "composite
regiment" and what is left of the first
division, "the first to go over and the
last to come back," tied up at Hoboken
at 9:55 o'clock, with the commander-in-chief
of the overseas forces on top of
its pilot house. Assembled on the pier
were nearly 1000 welfare workers, soldiers
and guests.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">General March Held Up</span></p>

<p>The first to board the vessel as soon as
the gangplank had been lowered, with
the exception of two naval officers, was
a party of newspaper correspondents
and photographers. At this point there
was an amusing incident that somewhat
relieved the anxiety and general excitement.
A sentry, seeing the correspondents
and photographers making ready
for an immediate rush on the vessel,
raised his voice in protest. General
Peyton C. March, chief of staff, stepped
forward with assurances that everything
would be all right. But the sentry,
sticking to his point with surprising determination,
in view of the high rank
he was addressing, would not be assured,
and those who were listening
understood his audacity when he stood
up straight in front of General March
and declared:</p>

<p>"But, sir, I have just been talking
with the secretary of war, sir, and he
says, sir, that no one can go aboard."</p>

<p>General March was as surprised as
any one else. Having no reply to make
to a declaration of that kind, despite
his rank, he sought out the secretary
of war and soon returned saying he had
"straightened things out." Then came
the laugh.</p>
            </td>
            <td style="width:50%" align="left" valign="top">


<p>"Very well, sir," said the sentry,
saluting nervously, and by this time in
perspiration from excitement. "B-b-b-but
I have only eight more days to
go and I-I-I naturally d-don't want to
get into any j-j-am with the secretary
of w-war, sir."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Met by Secretary Baker</span></p>

<p>As he stepped from the gangplank
General Pershing was greeted by Secretary
Baker and escorted to an open
space, where a small dais had been
erected in front of a group of chairs.
The chairs were occupied by the guests
and other staff officers, while Secretary
Baker and the guest of honor took
seats on the platform.</p>

<p>"Here there is to be a momentary
halt in the day's program to extend to
General Pershing a word of greeting and
a message from the President," said
Mr. Baker, opening the first ceremony
of the general's official welcome. "This
incident in today's events is to be brief,
and immediately after its conclusion
General Pershing will become the guest
of the city of New York."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Commission is Presented</span></p>

<p>Then it was that the secretary presented
the hero with his permanent
commission as general in the regular
army, after which he delivered a brief
address, closing with a message of
greeting from President Wilson.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pershing Remembers Dead</span></p>

<p>Secretary Baker then presented General
Pershing, who was received with
applause that lasted two minutes.</p>

<p>"If these compliments and tributes
are to continue for long," declared the
General, "I am sure that I shall wish
that the war had continued. To say
that I am happy would be a waste of
words. I cannot describe the emotions
that fill my heart. You have been very
complimentary to me, Mr. Secretary,
more complimentary than I deserve.
I can only reply by saying that the war
was won by the united effort of the
nation. The army abroad felt the
inspiration that came from the effort
of the people at home. The morale of
an army is dependent upon the morale
of the people behind it; and I am proud
to say that the morale of the American
people never gave us cause for anything
but inspiration.</p>

<p>"On an occasion of this kind we
must not forget the fellows who faced a
well-trained enemy with only partial
training themselves. It is to them we
owe the tribute. I hope their graves
may be fittingly decorated as an eternal
shrine to be visited by Americans in
the future as a place where the lesson
of patriotism may always be learned
anew.</p>

<p>"I wish to take this occasion to
thank the people, the President, and
you, Mr. Secretary, for the confidence
that was placed in me. This confidence
made the complex task in France inestimably
more easy."</p>

<p>Then came the street procession to
City Hall Park, through the "Broadway
Canyon."</p>

<p>People were crowded five and six
deep on both sides of the street; from
hundreds of office windows high in the
air there was a veritable snowfall of
confetti and torn bits of paper; miles
and miles of ticker tape thrown promiscuously</p>
            </td>
            <td style="width:50%" align="left" valign="top">
<p>from the same windows became
interlaced and tangled in midair,
giving the highway the aspect of a street
in another, more fantastic world; airplanes
glided as low as possible over the
thoroughfare; while whistles and automobile
horns blew and church bells
rang for an hour without intermission.</p>

<p>The crowds unleashed reserves of enthusiasm
that had been held in restraint
by recent strikes and other sober concerns.
"Here comes Pershing!" "Hurrah
for Black Jack!" "We're glad to
see you back!"</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Officially Welcomed By City</span></p>

<p>At City Hall General Pershing and
the members of his staff, who accompanied
him on the Leviathan, were
officially welcomed by the city. After
the addresses of the mayor and the
governor they were turned over to a
committee of citizens, headed by Rodman
Wanamaker. Here the general
made his second address since returning
from France, and, as before, emphasized
what seemed to be his central thought&mdash;that
he accepts the praise and the adulation
for and in the name of those who
fought and died.</p>

<p>After the City Hall exercises the procession
was resumed, this time on Fifth
Avenue.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Waldorf, the general
retired for a nap, apologizing, but declaring
that he needed rest badly.</p>

<p>A dinner tonight, followed by a theatre
party at the Hippodrome, both
given by the Rodman Wanamaker
committee, ended the day's celebration.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FAIRIES_ON_THE_GUMP" id="THE_FAIRIES_ON_THE_GUMP">THE FAIRIES ON THE GUMP</a></h2>


<blockquote><p>Long, long ago the original inhabitants of England were
driven by their enemies to take refuge in the western mountains,
many being forced to cross the water to Ireland. The
descendants of these people now live in Cornwall and in Wales
and they are quite different from the people of the rest of England.
This is a very pleasant retelling of one of their folk
tales.</p></blockquote>

<p>Down by St. Just, not far from Cape Cornwall and the
sea, is a small hill, called "The Gump", where the Small
People used to hold their revels, and where our grandfathers
and grandmothers used to be allowed to stand and
look on and listen.</p>

<p>People believed in the Fairies in those days, so the Fairies
in return often helped the people, and did them all sorts of
kindnesses. Indeed, they would do so now if folks had not
grown so learned and disbelieving. It seems strange that
because they have got more knowledge of some matters,
they should have grown more ignorant of others, and declare
that there never were such things as Fairies, just
because they have neither eyes nor minds to see them!</p>

<p>Of course, no one could expect the sensitive little creatures
to appear when they are sneered at and scoffed at. All the
same, though, they are as much about us as ever they were,
and if you or I, who do believe in the Little People, were to
go to the Gump on the right nights at the right hour, we
should see them feasting and dancing and holding their
revels just as of old. If, though, you do go, you must be
very careful to keep at a distance, and not to trespass on
their fairy ground, for that is a great offense.</p>

<p>There was, once upon a time, a grasping mean old fellow
who did so, and pretty well he was punished for his daring.
It is his story I am going to tell you.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, this old man used to listen to the tales the people
told of the Fairies and their riches, and their wonderful
treasures, until he could scarcely bear to hear any more, he
longed so to have some of those riches for himself; and at
last his covetousness grew so great, that he said to himself
he must and would have some, or he should die of vexation.</p>

<p>So one night, when the Harvest Moon was at the full, he
started off alone, and very stealthily, to walk to the Gump,
for he did not want his neighbors to know anything at all
about his plans. He was very nervous, for it is a very
desolate spot, but his greed was greater than his fear, and
he made himself go forward, though he longed all the time
to hurry home to the safe shelter of his house and his
bed.</p>

<p>When he was still at some distance from the enchanted
spot, strains of the most exquisite music anyone could possibly
imagine reached his ear, and as he stood listening it
seemed to come nearer and nearer until, at last, it was
close about him. The most wonderful part, though, of it
all was that there was nothing to be seen, no person, no
bird, not an animal even. The empty moor stretched away
on every side, the Gump lay bare and desolate before him.
The only living being on it that night was himself.</p>

<p>The music, indeed, seemed to come from under the
ground, and such strange music it was, too, so gentle, so
touching, it made the old miser weep, in spite of himself,
and then, even while the tears were still running down his
cheeks, he was forced to laugh quite merrily, and even to
dance, though he certainly did not want to do either.
After that it was not surprising that he found himself
marching along, step and step, keeping time with the music
as it played first slowly and with stately tread, then fast
and lively.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>All the time, though, that he was laughing and weeping,
marching or dancing, his wicked mind was full of thoughts
as to how he should get at the fairy treasure.</p>

<p>At last, when he got close to the Gump, the music ceased,
and suddenly, with a loud crashing noise which nearly scared
the old man out of his senses, the whole hill seemed to open
as if by magic, and in one instant every spot was lighted
up. Thousands of little lights of all colors gleamed everywhere,
silver stars twinkled and sparkled on every furze-bush,
tiny lamps hung from every blade of grass. It was
a more lovely sight than one ever sees nowadays. Then,
out from the open hill marched troops of little Spriggans.</p>

<p>Spriggans, you must know, are the Small People who live
in rocks and stones, and cromlechs, the most mischievous,
thievish little creatures that ever lived, and woe betide anyone
who meddles with their dwelling-places.</p>

<p>Well, first came all those Spriggans, and then a large
band of musicians followed by troops of soldiers, each troop
carrying a beautiful banner, which waved and streamed out
as though a brisk breeze were blowing, whereas in reality
there was not a breath of wind stirring.</p>

<p>These hosts of Little People quickly took up their places
in perfect order all about the Gump, and, though they
appeared quite unconscious of his presence, a great number
formed a ring all around the old man. He was greatly
amazed, but, "Never mind," he thought, "they are such
little whipper-snappers I can easily squash them with my
foot if they try on any May-games with me."</p>

<p>As soon as the musicians, the Spriggans, and the soldiers
had arranged themselves, out came a lot of servants carrying
most lovely gold and silver vessels, goblets, too, cut
out of single rubies, and diamonds, and emeralds, and every
kind of precious stone. Then came others bearing rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
meats and pastry, luscious fruits and preserves, everything,
in fact, that one could think of that was dainty and appetizing.
Each servant placed his burden on the tables in
its proper place, then silently retired.</p>

<p>Can you not imagine how the glorious scene dazzled the
old man, and how his eyes glistened, and his fingers itched
to grab at some of the wonderful things and carry them
off? He knew that even one only of those flashing goblets
would make him rich for ever.</p>

<p>He was just thinking that nowhere in the world could
there be a more beautiful sight, when, lo and behold! the
illumination became twenty times as brilliant, and out of
the hill came thousands and thousands of exquisitely dressed
ladies and gentlemen, all in rows, each gentleman leading
a lady, and all marching in perfect time and order.</p>

<p>They came in companies of a thousand each, and each
company was differently attired. In the first the gentlemen
were all dressed in yellow satin covered with copper-colored
spangles; on their heads they wore copper-colored
helmets with waving, yellow plumes, and on their feet yellow
shoes with copper heels. The flashing of the copper in the
moonlight was almost blinding. Their companions all were
dressed alike in white satin gowns edged with large turquoises,
and on their tiny feet pale blue shoes with buckles
formed of one large turquoise set in pearls.</p>

<p>The gentlemen conducted the ladies to their places on the
Gump, and with a courtly bow left them, themselves retiring
to a little distance. The next troop then came up;
in this the gentlemen were all attired in black trimmed with
silver, silver helmets with black plumes, black stockings
and silver shoes. Their ladies were dressed in pink embroidered
in gold, with waving pink plumes in their hair, and
golden buckles on their pink shoes. In the next troop the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
men were dressed in blue and white, and the ladies in green,
with diamonds all around the hem of the gown, flashing in
their hair, and hanging in long ropes from their necks; on
their green shoes single diamonds blazed and flashed.</p>

<p>So they came, troop after troop, more than I can describe,
or you could remember, only I must tell you that the last
of all were the most lovely. The ladies, all of whom had
dark hair, were clad in white velvet lined with the palest
violet silk, while round the hems of the skirts and on the
bodices were bands of soft white swansdown. Swansdown
also edged the little violet cloaks which hung from their
shoulders. I cannot describe to you how beautiful they
looked, with their rosy, smiling faces, and long black curls.
On their heads they wore little silver crowns set with amethysts;
amethysts, too, sparkled on their necks and over
their gowns. In their hands they carried long trails of the
lovely blossom of the wistaria. Their companions were
clad in white and green, and in their left hands they carried
silver rods with emerald stars at the top.</p>

<p>It really seemed at one time as though the troops of
Little People would never cease pouring out of the hill.
They did so at last, though, and as soon as all were in their
places the music suddenly changed.</p>

<p>The old man by this time seemed able to see more clearly,
and hear more distinctly, and his sense of smell grew keener.
Never were such flashing gems as here, never had any flowers
such scents as these that were here.</p>

<p>There were now thousands of little ladies gathered on the
Gump, and these all broke out into song at the same instant.
The words were in an unknown tongue, but the
song was evidently about some great personages who were
about to emerge from the amazing hill, for again it opened,
and again poured forth a crowd of Small People.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>First of all came a bevy of little girls in white gauze,
scattering flowers, which as soon as they touched the ground,
sprang up into full life and threw out leaves and more
flowers, full of exquisite scents; then came a number of
boys playing on shells as though they were harps, and making
ravishing music, while after them came hundreds and
hundreds of little men clad in green and gold, followed by a
perfect forest of banners spreading and waving on the air.</p>

<p>Then last, but more beautiful than all that had gone before,
was carried a raised platform covered with silk embroidered
with real gold, and edged with crystals, and on
the platform were seated a prince and princess of such surpassing
loveliness that no words can be found to describe
them. They were dressed in the richest velvet, and covered
with precious stones which blazed and sparkled in the myriad
lights until the eye could scarce bear to look at them.</p>

<p>Over her lovely robe the princess's hair flowed down to
the floor, where it rested in great shining, golden waves.
In her hand she held a golden sceptre, on the top of which
blazed a diamond as large as a walnut, while the prince
carried one with a sapphire of equal size. After a deal of
marching backwards and forwards, the platform was placed
on the highest point of the Gump, which was now a hill of
flowers, and every fairy walked up and bowed, said something
to the prince and princess, and passed on to a seat
at the tables.</p>

<p>At length all were seated, whereupon the prince gave a
signal, on which a number of footmen came forward carrying
a table laden with dainty food in solid gold dishes, and
wines in goblets of precious stones which they placed on the
platform before the prince and princess. As soon as the
royal pair began to eat, all the hosts around them followed
their example, and such a merry, jovial meal they had. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
viands disappeared as fast as they could go, laughter and
talk sounded on all sides, and never a sign did any of them
give that they knew that a human being was watching
them.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought the old miser to himself. "I can't get
all I'd like to, but if I could reach up to the prince's table
I could get enough at one grab to set me up for life!"</p>

<p>Stooping down, he slowly and stealthily dragged himself
nearer and nearer to the table. He felt quite sure that
no one could see him. What he himself did not see was
that hundreds of wicked little Spriggans had tied ropes on
to him and were holding fast to the ends. He crawled and
crawled so slowly and carefully that it took him some time
to get over the ground, but he managed it at last, and got
quite close up to the lovely little pair. Once there he
paused for a moment and looked back,&mdash;perhaps to see if
the way was clear for him to run when he had done what
he meant to do. He was rather startled to find that all
was as dark as dark could be, and that he could see nothing
at all behind him. However, he tried to cheer himself by
thinking it was only that his eyes were dazzled by looking
at the bright lights so long. He was even more startled,
though, when he turned round to the Gump again, to find
that every eye of all those hundreds and thousands of fairies
on the hill was looking straight into his eyes.</p>

<p>At first he was really frightened, but as they did nothing
but look, he told himself that they could not really be
gazing at him, and grew braver with the thought. Then
slowly bringing up his hat, as a boy does to catch a butterfly,
he was just going to bring it down on the silken platform
and capture prince and princess, table, gold dishes and all,
when hark! A shrill whistle sounded, the old man's hand,
with the hat in it, was paralyzed in the air, so that he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
not move it backwards or forwards, and in an instant every
light went out, and all was pitchy darkness.</p>

<p>There was a whir-r-r and a buzz, and a whir-r-r, as if
a swarm of bees were flying by him, and the old man felt
himself fastened so securely to the ground that, do what
he would, he could not move an inch, and all the time he
felt himself being pinched, and pricked, and tweaked from
top to toe, so that not an inch of him was free from torment.
He was lying on his back at the foot of the Gump,
though how he got there he could never tell. His arms
were stretched out and fastened down, so that he could
not do anything to drive off his tormentors, his legs were so
secured that he could not even relieve himself by kicking,
and his tongue was tied with cords, so that he could not call
out.</p>

<p>There he lay, no one knows how long, for to him it seemed
hours, and no one else but the fairies knew anything about
it. At last he felt a lot of little feet running over him, but
whose they were he had no idea until something perched on
his nose, and by the light of the moon he saw it was a
Spriggan. His wicked old heart sank when he realized that
he had got into their clutches, for all his life he had heard
what wicked little creatures they were.</p>

<p>The little imp on his nose kicked and danced and stamped
about in great delight at finding himself perched up so
high. We all know how painful it is to have one's nose
knocked, even ever so little, so you may imagine that the
old miser did not enjoy himself at all. Master Spriggan
did, though. He roared with laughter, as though he were
having a huge joke, until at last, rising suddenly to his
feet and standing on the tips of his tiny toes, he shouted
sharply, "Away! away! I smell the day!" and to the old
man's great relief off he flew in a great hurry, followed by all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
his mischievous little companions who had been playing
games, and running races all over their victim's body.</p>

<p>Left at last to himself, the mortified old man lay for
some time, thinking over all that had happened, trying to
collect his senses, and wondering how he should manage to
escape from his bonds, for he might lie there for a week
without any human being coming near the place.</p>

<p>Till sunrise he lay there, trying to think of some plan, and
then, what do you think he saw? Why, that he had not
been tied down by ropes at all, but only by thousands of
gossamer webs! And there they were now, all over him,
with the dew on them sparkling like the diamonds that the
princess had worn the night before. And those dewdrop
diamonds were all the jewels he got for his night's work.</p>

<p>When he made this discovery he turned over and groaned
and wept with rage and shame, and never, to his dying day,
could he bear to look at sparkling gold or gems.</p>

<p>At last, afraid lest he should be missed, and searchers be
sent out to look for him, he got up, brushed off the dewy
webs, and putting on his battered old hat, crept slowly
home. He was wet through with dew, cold, full of rheumatism,
and very much ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>Very good care he took to keep that night's experiences
to himself. No one must know his shame.</p>

<p>Years after, though, when he had become a changed man,
and repented of his former greediness, he let out the story
bit by bit to be a lesson to others, until his friends and
neighbors, who loved to listen to anything about fairies,
had gathered it all as I have told it to you here. And you
may be quite sure it is all true, for the old man was not
clever enough to invent it.</p>

<p>When we were very young we had a nursery rhyme which
told of an old witch who rode away upon a broomstick to
sweep the cobwebs from the sky. Of course we understood
that it was just a nonsense rhyme. But nowadays when
people can really fly up in the air, not on broomsticks but on
aeroplanes, it does not seem so nonsensical.</p>

<p>Suppose we agree to take a trip, in our imagination,
right away up into the sky till we reach the moon! Of
course, we can never hope really to fly to the moon. One
reason is that the air goes up only a comparatively short
distance. But you can do wonderful things in your imagination!
We shall suppose we have a machine that does
not require air in which to fly, and that we can live very
comfortably in an enclosed cabin attached to this wonderful
flying machine.</p>

<p>At what speed are we going to make our machine fly?
Some aeroplanes have traveled more than one hundred
miles in an hour, but that speed will be far too slow for us
because we have such great distances to go.</p>

<p>Flying at one hundred miles per hour, we should not reach
the moon for three months. And the moon is our nearest
neighbor in space. The sun is four hundred times as far
away as the moon, so it would take us a hundred years to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
reach the sun. And even this far-distant sun seems a near
neighbor when we think of the distance from us to the fixed
stars. To reach the nearest of the stars it would take us
millions of years. I am not going to ask you to imagine
yourself living for millions of years, shut up in the cabin of
our flying machine. It is quite evident that we must
increase the speed of our machine. Suppose we make it
go as fast as a ray of light can travel! How fast is that?</p>

<p>The speed of light is so great than any race we set for it
on this earth seems no time at all. You know that it takes
us several months to travel round this world in a steamer.
Of course we could go far faster in a flying machine. But
even if we could keep flying all the time at one hundred
miles per hour, it would take us ten days.</p>

<p>Suppose now that it were possible to send a ray of light on
this same journey around the world. It would have traveled
right round before you could count "one". Indeed it could
travel five hundred times round the world in one minute.
That may help to give you some vague sort of idea of the
speed at which our flying machine is to travel.</p>

<p>Even at this unthinkable speed, it would take us about
four years to reach the nearest star. Does it really take
light several years to travel from a star to us? It does; it
takes light hundreds of years to reach us from some of the
distant stars. If one of these far-distant stars should disappear
suddenly, you and I would know nothing about the
change. When we looked up into the sky we should still
see the star shining away year after year. Our children and
our grandchildren would still believe the star to be where
it had been always, for the last rays of light, sent out by the
star before it disappeared, would take hundreds of years to
reach this world. There is no hope of our ever reaching
these very distant stars in our imaginary flying machine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
it would be too big a tax on our imagination to live in the
cabin of our machine for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>For the present we shall be content with a trip to the
moon. But one boy says that he cannot imagine our
flying machine forcing its way through the air at the enormous
speed at which light travels. Even when traveling
by motor car, at the comparative snail-pace of, say, forty
miles per hour, we have to see that hats and veils are well
fastened on. This boy says that he has been told that a
good deal of the additional energy required to drive a train
at sixty miles an hour is used up in forcing the train through
the ocean of air.</p>

<p>We quite agree with this boy that it would be very difficult
to imagine our machine traveling through the air at
the speed of light. We shall get over this difficulty by
making our machine not exceed one hundred miles per
hour so long as we are in the ocean of air. When we get
beyond this great blanket of air, we can increase our speed
to that of light.</p>

<p>I am very glad that we have come to this arrangement,
for I had just been thinking that our journey to the moon
would be a very disappointing one, as it would have taken
only about one second to get there. Now our journey will
be much slower and we shall have time to look about us.</p>

<p>When we emerge from the misty clouds we cannot see
the instruments for the moisture on the window. By the
time it clears we are about two miles upwards off the
earth. We find that the temperature has fallen down below
freezing-point. We are rather surprised, as it looks lovely
and warm in the sunshine. The moment we shoot above
the clouds we are in the sunshine, with the sea of clouds
below us. Our thermometer is placed in the shade, so that
the direct rays of the sun cannot reach it, as we wish to
know the temperature of the surrounding air.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason why it is colder here than down on the surface
of the earth is that we have climbed out of the thickest
part of the great blanket of air which serves to keep you
warm. The air is what you might describe as much thicker
near the earth, but, to speak more correctly, we should say
that the air is much denser at the surface of the earth.
Up here it is much flimsier. One girl says that she climbed
a high mountain with her father, on a beautiful summer
day, and it was so cold on the top of the mountain they
could not stay there many minutes.</p>

<p>We keep rushing upwards and in half an hour we know
that we must be about fifty miles from the earth, as we have
been traveling at the rate of one hundred miles per hour.
The air at this height is so rare that we could not possibly
live in it. It is a good thing that we are in an enclosed
cabin, and have plenty of fresh air in liquid form, which
gives off ordinary air just at the rate we require it.</p>

<p>We know that in about an hour and a half we should be
clear of the atmosphere altogether, and that we may travel
thereafter at the speed of light, which means about eleven
million miles per minute.</p>

<p>One little girl says she is feeling very sleepy, and as she
was too excited to sleep much last night, I advise her to
lie down and have a sleep now; we shall waken her when
we arrive at the moon.</p>

<p>Imagine then that we have arrived at the moon. It looks
like our own world, "the earth," only there is nothing
growing on it; it seems to be all bare rocks. But the mountains
look very high; some of them are really higher than
the highest mountains on the earth.</p>

<p>Most of the children in our cabin say that they thought
the moon was quite smooth, and had a sort of polished
surface. When they were told that the moon did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
send out light, but merely reflected the light of the sun,
they pictured some sort of mirror-like surface.</p>

<p>We are startled by a sudden cry of surprise behind us;
the little girl who was sleeping has wakened up, and looking
out of the window behind us, she calls: "Oh! look how huge
the moon has grown! It is far, far bigger than the sun!"</p>

<p>Looking out at her window, we see what does look like
a giant moon. But our little friend is very much surprised
when I tell her that that is old Mother Earth, and that the
rocky mountains close to us are part of the moon. But how
can the earth shine like the moon? In exactly the same
way as the moon shines; both merely reflect the light sent
out by the sun.</p>

<p>We can scarcely believe that this "huge half-moon",
standing out so clearly against a jet-black sky, is really
the earth which we left a few hours ago in broad daylight.
But the people on the part of it which we speak of as shining
like the moon are still in broad daylight. Those people
living on the half of the great globe which appears dark to
us are in darkness except for the light which is reaching
them from this moon up here where we are at present.</p>

<p>One boy says that some of the astronomers on the earth
may be looking at us through their telescopes, and he
starts making Boy Scout signals with his arms. He is
disappointed when I tell him that the very best telescope
on earth would not enable the astronomers to see our
flying machine even as a speck on the face of the moon.
If our machine had been as big as one of our largest buildings,
it could then have been seen as a tiny dot.</p>

<p>But we cannot help staring at that great ball on which
we live, and which we left so recently. This distant view
gives us a good idea of how much bigger the earth is than
the moon. Of course if you look down at the moon at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
present you can get no idea of its size; you can see only a
small part of it, just as you could see only a small part of
the earth until you made this imaginary voyage skywards.
But you can remember what the moon looked like when
you saw it from the earth.</p>

<p>Looking back now at the far-distant earth, you would
say that it was much more than four times the size of the
moon. When we are comparing the sizes of the earth
and the moon, and the other heavenly bodies, it is usual
to speak of their diameters. The word <i>diameter</i> is made
out of two Greek words which mean <i>a measure through</i>.
The diameter of the moon or of the earth is just the distance
right through the center from one side to the other. We
say that the diameter of the earth is four times as great as
the diameter of the moon, but the earth could contain
sixty-four moons.</p>

<p>Suppose we take a quiet cruise about the moon in our
imaginary flying machine. One boy remarks that he is
glad it is a fine day, for, although we cannot leave the
cabin of our flying machine, we can see much better on a
fine day. Another boy says he guesses that if we were to
stay here for a hundred years it would be fine every day.
He is quite right. There are no clouds around the moon,
and so there cannot be any rain.</p>

<p>When we looked at the moon from the earth, the moon's
surface seemed to be beautifully smooth, but now that we
have traveled to it in our flying machine we find it to be
anything but smooth. It seems to be covered entirely
with high mountains, and great rings of mountains. One
boy says that those large basins formed by the rings of
mountains remind him of some mountains that he saw on
the earth, and that he was told the mountains had formed
the crater of a great volcano in the long ago.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>But what is a volcano? Although a volcano is described
often as a burning mountain, it is not really burning, but
it has a large chimney in the center of it reaching far down
into the earth. Great quantities of molten rock-material
are hurled up this chimney while the volcano is active.
There are a few active volcanoes on the earth today, but
there are traces of very many more that have long ceased
to be active.</p>

<p>One boy hopes that we may find an active volcano as we
cruise around the moon, but he will be disappointed. The
moon is no longer a hot body like the earth, and the earth
used to be very much hotter than at present, when there
were a great many volcanoes at work.</p>

<p>Looking at the moon, we can see that it must have been
very hot at one time also; it seems so covered with volcanic
mountains that one ring sometimes overlaps another.</p>

<p>But what is this huge dark-colored part of the moon?
One boy guesses that it is a sea or a lake, and when I tell
him that there is no water on the moon he is very much
surprised. He says that there must have been water at
one time, for he has seen a map of the moon, and it contained
a lot of Latin names which his tutor told him meant
the Sea of Rains, the Sea of Tranquillity, the Lake of
Dreams, and so on.</p>

<p>No doubt the map which the boy saw was quite a correct
map of the moon, for we speak of those dark patches as
seas and lakes, although we know now that no water exists,
and probably never existed, on the moon.</p>

<p>It is those great dark patches on the moon which seem
to form the man's face; this dark patch which we are
coming to is the one which forms his right eye. It is called
the Sea of Rains.</p>

<p>How bright the mountains look in the sunshine, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
black their shadows are. That is because there is no air.
Notice how very clearly you can see the far-distant
mountain ranges. You can scarcely believe me when I
tell you that the mountains on either side of that great
crater are more than one hundred miles apart. But do
you not remember how the mountains on the earth have
appeared to us sometimes to be very much nearer than
usual? If you asked the reason for this, you were told
that it was because the atmosphere happened to be particularly
clear. Well! here on the moon we have no air at
all and that is why we can see everything so very clearly.</p>

<p>One little girl says that she had been wondering why
there is nothing growing on the moon, but now she sees
that not even grass, nor moss, nor heather could grow,
since there is no air and no water. Not only are the
mountains bare rock, but the whole surface of the land is
the same.</p>
